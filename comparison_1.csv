NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup's Chief Economist Nathan Sheets said on Tuesday the U.S. has a 40% to 45% chance of recession as the economy suffers the impact of tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump on China and other trading partners.

Sheets expects GDP to grow in the second quarter, pushed by consumers rushing to make purchases ahead of tariffs coming into effect. The largest impact on U.S. growth is expected during the second half of the year, Sheets told clients in a conference call.","Yes, end of July and August is going to be a bloodbath.Last year Those months weren't very fun, especially August.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup's Chief Economist Nathan Sheets said on Tuesday the U.S. has a 40% to 45% chance of recession as the economy suffers the impact of tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump on China and other trading partners.

Sheets expects GDP to grow in the second quarter, pushed by consumers rushing to make purchases ahead of tariffs coming into effect. The largest impact on U.S. growth is expected during the second half of the year, Sheets told clients in a conference call.

""We think the odds are still 40-45% of a recession,"" Sheets said. ""We think the first half is probably the bottom, and we're looking for a rebound in the second half of the year, but it's going to be a challenging time for the economy.""

Sheets added that the U.S. is in a ""very difficult position"" with China.

""The challenge is that we're now in a position where we're now in a trade war with China, and that's going to have a negative impact on the economy,"" Sheets said. ""We think the tariff impacts are going to be a headwind for the economy.""

Sheets also said that a recession in Europe is a risk, but he does not see one on the horizon.

The U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2% this year, Sheets said.","Citi says odds of recession in US close to 45%, largest effect of tariffs to happen in second half

Sheets expects GDP to grow in the second quarter, pushed by consumers rushing to make purchases ahead of tariffs coming into effect. The largest impact on U.S. growth is expected during the second half of the year, Sheets told clients in a conference call.

""The impact of the tariffs on growth are likely to be felt most in the second half of this year,"" Sheets said. ""The extent to which the tariffs impact the U.S. economy will depend on the timing and sequencing of the tariffs.""

Sheets said the risk of a recession has increased as the economy faces the headwinds of higher tariffs and higher unemployment. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.5% from 3.5% in April, Sheets said.

# As I said yesterday, the market is overreacting to the tariffs. 

# No way we go into a recession. Tariffs will have a bigger impact on inflation, not on GDP growth.

"Widower finance advice after wife passed away and more then half income is gone.
Ok so I'm writing this on a whim to keep my brain busy for a moment. My wife passed away on sunday and she made about 60% of our income. My current main bills are more then i can afford without changing something. 
The main thing i need help deciding on is if I should refinance the house ASAP or wait for better rates.

Mortgage 3030 monthly
Principal is at about 435k at 7.3%.

I currently have 50k in a HYSA at 4% and we have a 275k life insurance policy that I'll get eventually. So I'm looking at it like if I get the money and have 300k in the HYSA I'll get 1k per month I can use towards Mortgage and  The rest will pay for funeral and pay off the truck we just bought and the camper.

There's obviously a lot of variables im leaving out to simplify this but I'm hoping to have something kinda nudge me a way since my brain isn't exactly working 100% at the moment. 

Suppose I should show my income too...im currently able to work overtime and I'm getting 105 per diem daily but those are extras so its not guaranteed. Otherwise I made almost 80k last year with some overtime using 4 weeks of  PTO.

Comment: My heart goes out to you.  It's a very difficult time.  The answer to your question will be different for every family, and every situation is different.  You should probably consult with an attorney and/or a financial planner to help you make the best decisions.

Comment: I appreciate the comment. I don't think it's a matter of what is best but just trying to make the best of the situation.

Comment: I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you'll be able to make it through the difficult time.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}

I currently have 50k in a HYSA at 4% and we have a 275k life insurance policy that I'll get eventually.
\end{blockquote}

I'd take out the HELOC now. Get it while the interest rates are low.

\begin{blockquote}

Suppose I should show my income too...im currently able to work overtime and I'm getting 105 per diem daily but those are extras so its not guaranteed. Otherwise I made almost 80k last year with some overtime using 4 weeks of  PTO.

\end{blockquote}

I would suggest that you take out the HELOC now and then use the HELOC to pay off the mortgage.  I would take out the HELOC at the current interest rate and then pay it off with HELOC funds.  This would reduce your HELOC interest rate.

I would also suggest that you consider a part time job if you can.  You may be able to get a part time job at a restaurant or other service job.  This would give you more income to pay off the HELOC.

Comment: Thank you for the comment. I don't think I can get the HELOC at the current rate. It's been in place for about 10 years so I think it's a set rate. I'll have to look at that. I think the HELOC will be around 10% or so. I'll have to check","Widower finance advice after wife passed away and more then half income is gone.

I'm sure I'm forgetting something important but let's start with this.

Refinance and have to pay a bunch of closing costs and then have a lower payment but it's a lower interest rate. 

Or wait until I get the money and use the HYSA for a year or so and then pay off the truck and camper and the mortgage in a lump sum. 

I'm not sure how much I can put towards the mortgage each month. 

Or some other option I'm not thinking of.

Edit:

I've been able to take home 1450 weekly after taxes and 401k and life insurance deductions. 

Mortgage is 15 year. 

I'm not sure what the rate is on the mortgage. I think it was 7.3% but not positive.

The camper and truck are paid off.

We also have a 2011 Jeep Wrangler that I'm trying to sell.

The HYSA is just a place to keep money for the mortgage and the life insurance will be enough to cover that. 

I'm sorry if this is a dumb question but I'm just trying to figure out the best way to deal with the situation.

Edit 2:

I'm not sure if I should post this but I had 600k in a 401k. It's been rolled over to a Roth IRA. 401k was through my job and the Roth was from my wife. I'm not sure what the split is but I'm guessing it's about half and half. I'm not sure if I should roll it all over or just a portion. I'm not sure how to figure that out. I'm going to see if I can find the paperwork from when she rolled it over.

Edit 3:

Ok I guess I'll post the 401k information. I'll just put it in a spoiler for privacy reasons.

"Are Target Date Funds the best choice for *tax advantaged accounts”?
Why are Target Date Funds (TDF) the best choice for most people \*in tax advantaged accounts\* who want to use a Boglehead strategy.   Once your choose your TDF fund that matches your investment strategy (that may or may not line up to the year listed.) The TDF takes the ""and chill"" to the next optimal level.

   

TDF do two things very efficiently and often at the same time.  

1.  Buy low / Sell high  



2.  Automatic rebalancing

 

 

For example, let’s consider a simplistic TDF composed of two sub-funds in the following percentages:

 

VT   60%

 

BND  40%

 

 

Note 1:  TDF funds keep money in cash for ease of transactions.   If person A buys $2,000 of the TDF and person B sells $1,000 of the TDF, all that will go in and out from the cash.   These examples ignore that or assume larger amounts. 

 

Note 2:  The targets in real life are not perfect percentages with absolutes.  I think I read that Vanguard allows up to 2% (200 basis points) variance for their TDFs.

 

Note 3:  What makes them great for tax advantaged accounts (like 401(k), IRA, Roth) makes them less efficient for taxable accounts. 

 

Examples below are simplified.

  

 

 

For new money coming in (buying), the TDF manager will buy in the sub-fund that is underrepresented, aka – buy the dip.

 

1)  If VT has risen to 63% of the total fund and BND is 37%, the fund manager will direct all new money to buy BND (the less expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40.

 

2)  If VT falls to 57% of the total fund and BND is 43%, the fund manager will direct all new money to buy VT (the less expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40.

 

 

 

For money going out (selling), the TDF manager will sell the sub-fund that is overrepresented aka – profit taking



3)  If VT has risen to 63% of the total fund and BND is 37%, the fund manager will sell VT (the more expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40.

 

4)  If VT falls to 57% of the total fund and BND is 43%, the fund manager will sell BND (the more expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40.

 

 

   

For larger swings, when the fund is out of target and buy/sell orders are not enough, funds will rebalance when the sub-funds hit a pre-defined out of range limit (for this example, 2% off target).  

 

5)  If VT has risen to 63% of the total fund and BND is 37%, the fund manager will sell VT (the more expensive option) to buy BND (the less expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40 .

 

6)  If VT falls to 57% of the total fund and BND is 43%, the fund manager will sell BND (the more expensive option) to buy VT (the less expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40.

3)  If the total fund falls to 50/50, the fund manager will direct all new money to buy BND until we again reach the 60/40.

 

 

For new money coming out (selling), the TDF manager will sell in the sub-fund that is overrepresented, aka – sell the top.

 

1)  If VT is at 60% of the total fund and BND is at 40%, the fund manager will direct all new money to sell BND (the more expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40.

 

2)  If VT is at 40% of the total fund and BND is at 60%, the fund manager will direct all new money to sell VT until we again reach the 60/40.

 

3)  If the total fund is at 50/50, the fund manager will direct all new money to sell VT until we again reach the 60/40.

 

 

As long as the total fund stays within 60/40, there is no change in the asset allocation of the TDF. 

 

 

In a taxable account, the TDF manager will keep a 60/40 VT/BND in cash until the account balance falls below 60/40. 

 

In a tax advantaged account, the TDF manager will not keep a 60/40 VT/BND in cash until the account balance falls below 60/40. 

 

 

I’ll let you ponder the next question:

 

 

Why is the TDF manager not keeping a 60/40 VT/BND in cash in the tax advantaged account?

 

 

To me, it’s because of the tax penalty.

1. Wall Street Journal (online) for latest general business news and watchlist activity.
2. Trading Economics for worldwide news, daily calendar for reports (e.g. CPI, PMI, etc.) , index data.
3. Barchart  for SPXW specific information
4. FinViz news.
5. EU and Asian markets activity.
6. Bloomberg markets.

That routine lasts from 8:30 to 9:30. And then every 15 minutes or so thereafter depending on the markets (e.g. FED notes when released at 2:00PM ET.)

No technical analysis (ever)\*. No Trump news (or tweets.) No political reporting. No bullshit stuff like the latest Hollywood crap.

After markets close at 4:00PM ET I sometimes go to the club range for a round of skeet or two, or the indoor range for some target shooting. My charitable work is threaded through the day as time permits. Again, NO technical analysis.

I use a few apps but I think the most important is Seeking Alpha. I use the app for stock news and the website for sector news. I also use Benzinga for sector news.


Also I like to check out the charts for the stocks I'm trading. I like to use Trading View for that. It's free and gives a nice overview of the stock. I also use the chart for a real time picture of what's happening.


The other thing I like to do is read the filings. I like to use EDGAR Online for that. It's not free but I think it's worth the money. I like to read the quarterly filings and other important filings. The company's financials are also helpful.


I also like to use Seeking Alpha for the stock rating. It's not free but I think it's worth it. I also like to use the ""Best Ideas"" list for new ideas.


I also like to use the website Investopedia. They have a free tool where you can type in a stock and it will give you the news and chart. It's a nice overview.


I also like to use Bloomberg. It's not free but it's a nice overview of the market. It also has a good stock rating system.

"How to plan around a pension?
I have to specify this is not a '10% to your salary in an account each year' deal, this is a full-on, old-school pension. I'm six months into a company that I am loving, I am vested at the five year mark. Until now I've just been trying to max out my 401K and IRA account, but now I'm doing the long math with the pension app's estimations and have no idea how and if I should modify my behaviors at all. 

Even if I quit directly after being vested (I'll be 39), I'll still collect about 160K lifetime total if I start collecting at 65. Do I ignore the pension existing until I'm fully vested? Relax my savings a bit because this is padding I never planned around? Keep the same momentum going, and just make what I make at full steam plus pension?","I like Dave Ramsey's advice. His baseline recommendation is to save 15% of household income for retirement. 

if you have a **mandatory** pension contribution, count the contribution at about 50%. if you're forced to save 6% into the pension, count it at about 3% and save another 12% into 401k, 457, IRA, etc. 

this advice is due to several facts: the pension is not under your control; pensions can vary a lot in how well they're managed; pensions may or may not have inflation adjustments; in extreme cases like Detroit's bankrupcy, pension benefits can even be cut for retirees; a lot can change in people's lives and careers and you may not work with the pension job as long as you anticipate; etc etc etc. 

if you have a non-contributory pension, just save the standard 15%.","How to plan around a pension?

I have a few months before I get vested, so I'm hoping to have a solid plan by then.

Comment: What's the vesting schedule?

Comment: @JoeTaxpayer I'm 15% vested at the 12 month mark, 25% at the 24 month mark, 33% at the 36 month mark, and 50% at the 48 month mark.

Comment: How much is your employer contributing to the pension?

Comment: @JoeTaxpayer It's a full pension, where the company contributes 100% of my contribution, and I contribute the first 4% of my salary, and the company matches that 100%.

Comment: @JoeTaxpayer The pension is a very good deal, but I'm trying to figure out how to adjust my own savings to it.

Comment: You're already saving 16% of your salary, so I wouldn't worry about that.

Comment: @JoeTaxpayer Is that too much? I was thinking of trying to save a bit less, so I can spend a bit more in retirement.

Comment: @JoeTaxpiler I'm going to guess the pension is a defined benefit pension, not a defined contribution pension.

Comment: @JoeTaxpiler: I would guess that the pension is defined contribution, based on the matching.

Comment: @JoeTaxpiler Yes, it's a defined contribution.

Answer: You have a very good pension plan. You don't need to change a thing, just keep doing what you've been doing.

In other words, you are already doing what you need to do.

Comment: I'm pretty sure this is the correct answer.

Comment: I'm not sure. I don't have a pension, but I'm a lot closer to retirement than the OP. I've been saving 20% of my salary, but I'm nowhere near 100% vested. I think I'll try to increase my savings rate.

"Annual Career Bonuses

Some additional information - I am currently maxing my TSP (federal 401k equivalent), maxing Roth IRA, ineligible for a HSA (I believe because I receive all healthcare through DoD). Also investing in taxable brokerage accounts - only VOO and VTI currently.

Comment: @Anonymous: Yes, I am happy, but I am also a big fan of diversification. I've been investing in VOO and VTI for the past 4 years and am looking for other options to consider.

Comment: @Anonymous - The key is to diversify, but not to diversify at the expense of being overly concentrated in a few assets. I would say that VTI, VOO, and VXUS are all in the same asset class. It's a matter of how much you want to own, not whether you should own it.

Comment: @Anonymous - *""I would say that VTI, VOO, and VXUS are all in the same asset class.""* - I disagree. VTI is the S&P500 while VOO is the S&P500/1000 (with about 400 stocks added). VXUS is the MSCI World ex-US.

Comment: @Anonymous - I think you'll find that ""diversification"" is a misnomer in this case.

Comment: @Anonymous - I agree with you that there are differences between these three funds. However, I don't think it's a case of diversification. I think it's a case of deciding how much you want to own of a particular asset class.

###Question:
If you are maxing out your TSP, you should be able to max out your Roth IRA. If you are in the military, you are allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA.

You can look at this [link](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-advantaged_accounts#United_States) to understand the tax advantages of a Roth IRA.

>Also investing in taxable brokerage accounts - only VOO and VTI currently.

I would not invest in VTI/VOO. I would invest in a [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) of US total market, ex-US total market, and US bonds.

>Am I wrong to take these annual bonuses and invest in some combination of VOO/VTI/VXUS?

I think you need to consider what your [investment horizon](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_horizon) is. If you have a short horizon, you might want to invest in a [target date fund](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Target_date_funds). If you have a long horizon, you might want to invest in a [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) of US total market, ex-US total market, and US bonds.

>Any thoughts to how I can best apply these annual lump sums?

You might want to use the [prioritization](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments) table to determine where to invest your money.

I'm not sure if I can do all these, but it's good to have options right?
I'm also thinking of making a small investment in some stocks that have a great potential, but they are not dividend stocks, and I'm not sure if I can do that too, without risking too much.
I don't have a huge amount of cash to invest, but it's better than nothing.

Do you think this is a good start?
Do you have any tips on how to start investing, and which stocks are good for a 22 year old?
Thank you, and I hope you had a great day!
I'd suggest starting with the three index funds you mentioned, as they are all very low-cost. They will give you broad exposure to the US stock market and will be a great start.
It's really hard to go wrong with any of the index funds you mentioned.
I'd also suggest looking at the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX) - this is a US-only fund and tracks the S&P 500.
I'd also suggest looking at the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) - this fund tracks the entire US stock market.
Another great fund that I'd suggest looking at is the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund (VEXAX) - this fund tracks the entire US stock market, but excludes the largest 500 companies.
You'll probably want to start out with these three funds (VOO, QQQ, and SCHD) in your portfolio, as they will give you broad exposure to the US stock market and will be a great start.

I have a $7200 check coming in the mail from my job l left, and have done a bunch of research in the past week to figure out which stocks I would want to put my money into, since I chose to have mine managed via my 401k. So far while I would like to dip my toe in REITS, high dividend stocks, and index funds, 1 also would like to try to aim in having $500 as passive come a week. I get $7200 isn't possible with that, but I know it's a start, l've also heard calls can do good payout.
The stocks that I'm considering are
VOO(index)
QQQ(index)
SCHD (dividend)
JEPQ (dividend)
VIG (dividend)
VYM (dividend)
REITS (I know this is super volatile but I'm also going to do a 401k with my job)
I know I'm all over the place but I'm 22 and want to get my feet wet with some solid stocks that I can at least get a good payout weekly. I was looking for some advice and what you guys would recommend to get started. Thanks in advance.
Edit: I also have a 401k through my job



Edit 2: I also wanted to add that my job is in healthcare and I make around 70k.

Edit 3: I have around 13k in savings, and I've been saving around 1k a month for the last year.

Edit 4: I'm only 22 so I'm new to this and want to make sure I'm doing the right thing.

Edit 5: I'm not trying to get rich off of this, I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing and have a solid passive income stream.

Edit 6: I'm going to use my 401k for my job to also invest in some of the stocks I listed above.

Edit 7: I'm not looking for any financial advice, I'm just looking for what people would do if they were in my situation.

Edit 8: I don't want to put all my money in one stock, I'm looking for a solid passive income weekly.

Edit 9: I know I listed a bunch of stocks but I'm not going to invest in them all, I'm just looking for some advice from people that have been in my shoes.

Edit 10: I'm going to stick to my plan of saving 1k a month, I just want to know what the right thing is to do with the 7200 check.

Many traders do TA and act accordingly. For that reason the TA is often a self fulfilling prophecy... When there is a resistance visible on the chart then I dont ask for higher prices, and other dont ask for higher prices. When there is a support then I dont bid for lower prices and most of the others dont do that either. That's how I trade. I dont care for the other stuff.

but others do so. And if a breakout happens we look into the past, former ATHs, Fibonacci extensions. At least US traders do so. And nearly all hired workforce actively trading are asked to read some classical books about TA. E,g, the last time when WTI oil was weak a trading tutor said well in 2023 we were at $63.

Even if the dollars buying power was far less the $63 was still intact as support. Also TA...","Technical Analysis is astrology for traders

This is a thread for those who still believe in TA and want to learn how to trade.

Ask questions, share your experience.

Let’s talk about trading.

# Market Structure

Markets are composed of three layers:

- **Clean price action**: order book, liquidity zones, liquidity spikes

- **Insider flows**: institutional buying/selling, hedge fund positions

- **Narratives**: headlines, macro events (ECB, Fed, elections), earnings, sentiment shifts

# Liquidity Events

**The liquidity spiral**:

- 10% of volume moves in a short period
- Liquidity is concentrated in specific areas
- Price action is chaotic, explosive

**News-related spikes**:

- The price can move 10%+ in a few minutes
- Insiders are buying/selling aggressively
- Liquidity is concentrated in specific areas

**Liquidity spikes**:

- 10% of volume moves in a short period
- Liquidity is concentrated in specific areas
- Price action is chaotic, explosive

# Trading Strategies

**Position sizing**:

- Buy/sell based on market structure, not on TA
- Position size depends on volume, not Fibonacci ratios

**Risk management**:

- Maximum loss per trade
- Stop-loss and take-profit rules

**Trading plan**:

- Entry, stop-loss, take-profit
- Maximum loss, max profits
- Position size, exit rules

# Conclusion

Technical Analysis is good at explaining the past, but it can't predict the future.

Instead of looking for patterns, traders should focus on market structure, insider flows, and narratives.

* No credit card debt.
* Currently I am living at home with my parents (but I am looking for a place to move out to).
* I have a job that pays well but I am looking for another job.

I have thought about buying a rental property in the future but I don't want to over extend myself.

What I would like to do:

* Buy a home in a good location.
* Save more for retirement.
* Look for another job to increase my income.
* Start a Roth IRA

I have a few questions:

1) Is there a way to get a Roth IRA started?
2) Is there a good time to start looking for another job?
3) What is the best way to save more for retirement?
4) How do I know if I am on the right track and if I should consult with an advisor?
5) What are some good books to read to learn more about saving money?

Thanks!

Comment: You should ask these questions to your parents.

Comment: @JoeTaxpayer - Good point, but I'm not sure that's the answer.

Comment: I think that depends on where you are at. If you have a 401k and a Roth IRA, then you are in a good place. But if you are trying to buy a home, then you might want to consult with an advisor.

Comment: @JoeTaxpayer - I'd say the parents have the same advice as the advisor, but they might be more inclined to tell the son to stop asking questions.

Comment: @JoeTaxpayer: I think the OP is in a good place. He has a good job, he's saved a little bit, he's not in debt. He's not asking about his current situation, he's asking about his future plans.

Comment: @JoeTaxpayer - I'd say the parents have the same advice as the advisor, but they might be more inclined to tell the son to stop asking questions.

Comment: @JoeTaxpayer: Yes, but the son doesn't want to ask them about it, and the son's parents will be much more understanding of the son's situation","When to see a Advisor?

My Questions:

1. Do I need to speak with an advisor?
2. Is it a good idea to get a second job sooner rather than later?
3. What should I look for in an advisor?

"Are the 15% corporate rate tax cuts priced in? If not, when would they boost stocks?
Trump's big beautiful bill will cut corporate tax rates to a historic low of 15%. They current are 21% so that is a huge drop for companies.

Israel  23%

Vietnam  20%

When would this get priced into the stocks? Will they rally as the bill gets closer to law?  Or would it just rally after passing?

Comment: See also [How to profit from the Trump tax plan](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/11/trump-tax-plan.asp).

Comment: You're right.  I was looking for some more specific thoughts.  I'll take a look at that article.  Thanks!

Answer: \begin{blockquote}

When would this get priced into the stocks? Will they rally as the bill gets closer to law? Or would it just rally after passing?
\end{blockquote}

It will be priced in as soon as the bill is announced and the stock market will rally in anticipation.

The actual implementation of the law will likely take some time to be fully realized, so there will be some lag time between the announcement and the stock market rallying.

Comment: I'll have to look for some more information on that.  I'm looking for some more specific thoughts.  Thanks!

Comment: I would guess that a lot of investors are holding off on buying stocks until this gets passed.  I'm just looking for some more insight on this.

Comment: @user1320001 I think the stock market is already pricing in the tax cuts, but I could be wrong. The best way to find out is to wait and see.

Comment: I've been watching the stock market for a few weeks now and it seems like it's been rallying since the Trump win.  I think it's already priced in but I could be wrong.","Are the 15% corporate rate tax cuts priced in? If not, when would they boost stocks?

I'm not even a Trump fan, but this is good news for the US economy.  It's good news for stocks.

I'm guessing it won't rally until it gets passed, and even then it might not rally right away.  It might rally later once companies start announcing they will hire more workers, and more capital expenditures.  There is a lot of pent up demand for capital expenditures because of the 2017 tax bill.

Hi guys:

Yesterday at 1:38pm, Trump announced the following below. Coincidentally, QQQ was ramping up somewhat aggressively for close to 90min and headed to the resistance of the 50 day EMA. The Qs already gave a warning at 1:28pm when it was .39 away from the bottom of the EMA cloud and started to fade. Negative news pieces like this drop almost every time an index or stock are near resistance levels. The prudent move would be to buy puts here as close to the EMA as possible. If you look at the bigger picture, QQQ hasn't been above the 50 day ema since Feb 24th so it most certainly was going to act as resistance until it flips to support eventually. The news just made the flush more violent and quick and the indices did recover later but catching those moves can be nice for a decent intraday gain. Good luck, keep your eyes open during this crazy tape and can certainly bank well on this volatility.

Anyone who thinks that it isn't being manipulated is lying to themselves.

I was bullish going into the weekend off the Friday pump. Also rumors that DJT was giving inside information to Wall Street on trade announcements.","We don't make the rules but we have to play by them to outperform.

Comment: I dont know why this was downvoted but this is the first post I've seen that wasnt a spammy post. I've been trying to figure out how to get the QQQ to break down below the 50 day EMA and this was the perfect opportunity. I'm not sure if I should wait for the Qs to break down and retest the previous low or if I should buy puts here. I'm just trying to understand the market here and see how it works.

Answer: It looks like you are on the right track.  I would recommend waiting for a few more bars of volatility to get some better clarity","We don't make the rules but we have to play by them to outperform.
Hi guys:

Yesterday at 1:38pm, Trump announced the following below. Coincidentally, QQQ was ramping up somewhat aggressively for close to 90min and headed to the resistance of the 50 day EMA. The Qs already gave a warning at 1:28pm when it was .39 away from the bottom of the EMA cloud and started to fade. Negative news pieces like this drop almost every time an index or stock are near resistance levels. The prudent move would be to buy puts here as close to the EMA as possible. If you look at the bigger picture, QQQ hasn't been above the 50 day ema since Feb 24th so it most certainly was going to act as resistance until it flips to support eventually. The news just made the flush more violent and quick and the indices did recover later but catching those moves can be nice for a decent intraday gain. Good luck, keep your eyes open during this crazy tape and can certainly bank well on this volatility.

"This market is disgustingly overpriced, and we are due for a correction similar to what we saw during Dot Com/Global financial crisis.
I want to preface this by stating that I legitimately home someone can refute what I have to say here. I take no pleasure in the thought of people's 401k's and IRA's and pension funds getting absolutely decimated, and this post has nothing to do with politics... I think the market has been overpriced for a long time (+/- 8 years), and it is only getting worse.

**Some quick points:**

**1. Price to earnings ratio**

Price to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy. The S&P 500 is over 28 today, and before the market started correcting in February, we were actually over 31. The Nasdaq is at 37 and was as high as 44. While I imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what P/E means -- for those that don't -- here's a quick summary. For purposes of this post, let's use NVDA as an example. Assume NVDA didn't have a single penny in expenses. They didn't have to pay for employees. They had no rent. There was no salary for Jensen Huang, and they didn't have to pay a penny in taxes. They somehow got all their electricity for free, and they didn't even have a COGS (cost of goods sold) -- somehow they were getting all of their materials for free. Then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today... that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today, and they took 100% of that revenue, and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company. Right now -- NVDA's P/E is at 45.43 -- meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money.

The entire S&P is trading over 28 today... meaning if the +/- 500 largest companies in the USA didn't have a single expense, and continued generating the same revenue, it would take 28 years for investors to get their money back.

Who in the world would be interested in signing up for that ""investment"" opportunity? My own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and I wouldn't invest based on that return.

**2. The Buffett indicator**

The Buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the US stock market divided by GDP.

Historically, that number has hung out right around 1-- meaning the total value of the US stock market should be roughly the same as GDP. Buffett himself stated a value of 75-90% is reasonable, and a value over 120% signals the market is overpriced. The highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble, when it was 2.1 standard deviations above the trendline. The highest until now, that is. The market value is currently 211% of GDP, or almost 70% above what historically has been seen as normal.

**3. The stock market is insanely top heavy.**

The Mag 7 currently account for 31% of the S&P 500, and over 40% of the Nasdaq. If these 7 stocks correct, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the market as a whole. We saw this play out during Dot Com with the likes of Cisco, Intel, and Oracle. While the market was top heavy then -- it was nowhere near as top heavy as it is today... In fact -- the top 10 most valuable companies now represent more than twice as much of a percentage of value in the market as the top 10 did when Dot Com crashed.

Side note -- but I do think investors have briefly taken note of this. So much of these companies is based on perceived future growth based on revenue that can/will be generated by AI. But remember what happened when DeepSeek emerged last year -- and alerted WallStreet that an incredibly sophisticated AI can be created without pouring billions of dollars into R&D and infrastructure? The market absolutely tanked. What if it becomes obvious that these AI plays will not be unique to the largest tech companies in the world, and that these systems can be developed by any mid-cap with a decent budget?

**4. Home prices and the Housing Market**

I won't dive too deep into this, but homes are more unaffordable today than at any point in US history. Based on median US income and Median US home price, right before the Global financial crisis/mortgage crisis of 08/09 -- this number hit it's highest point in US history -- 45%.

Its highest percent *until* the last 12 months. It now takes over 46% of a family's income to purchase a home.  
30% is the figure that is generally regarded as affordable.

The condo market is collapsing, particularly in Florida, where HOA dues and Insurance costs have made these properties completely unaffordable.

Foreclosures on FHA loans are also set to resume. Biden put in place a policy where anyone that wanted could simply apply for a mortgage payment deferment after COVID... meaning call your servicer, say you're experiencing a hardship, and they simply give you a deferral. None of these homes could be foreclosed upon. They then tack these payments on to the back end of the loan with the additional accrued interest. This policy still exists today, but is about to come to an end in September. As of Q1 2025, over 10.6% of all FHA mortgages are at least one payment late. Over 4% of FHA mortgages are over 90 days late.

What happens when FHA foreclosures absolutely flood the market?

What does this do to home prices, and even more importantly, what does this do to homebuilders? If inventory skyrockets (more than it already has over the last couple of months), and price pressure pushes everything down due to increased supply, will home builders still be able to make money? Homebuilding employs over 11 million americans... Plumbers, electricians, roofers, landscapers, drywallers, framers, truck drivers, etc --

When homes stop being built, unemployment skyrockets, and GDP shrinks dramatically.

**5. Consumer debt is through the roof**

Credit card debt is at the highest it's ever been, and delinquency rates are as high as they've been since emerging from the global financial crisis. Q4 of 2011 was the last time delinquency rates were this high.

Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been in decades.

**6. Bonds -- worldwide -- are pushing higher and higher.**

The US is getting hit here worse than most, as it seems people are not excited about Trump's game of chicken with tariffs. Nonetheless -- you are seeing bond yields push higher and higher worldwide, as investors demand higher returns for government bonds to account for their perceived risk. Interest rates cuts have not quelled this. Despite 100bps cuts in the federal funds rate since last year, the 10 year t-note is actually up 80 ticks since then.

**7. Commercial real estate**

A massive amount of commercial real-estate will need to be refinanced in the coming 12-24 months -- and you will see these payments skyrocket. Many holders of Commercial real-estate refinanced their properties in the quarters after COVID, when interest rates were incredibly low. Most of these loans are either done on 5-year balloons, or as adjustable rate mortgages. These owners will see their payments jump by 30,50, even 70% as they are forced to refinance these properties and interest rates that are close to double what they were last time. This will be compounded by the fact that many companies moved to work from home models, or at least partial work from home models. Office space vacancy rates have skyrocketed -- meaning less tenants -- all while mortgage payments on these properties is skyrocketing.

**8. Student Loan Debt**

The government's moratorium on student loan payments has officially come to an end. 43 million Americans that have been been able to avoid making payments on their average of $38k in student loan debt for the last 5+ years are now going to have to start making payments. Those that don't will see their credit score be absolutely decimated. What other payments will the begin to fall behind on? As I mentioned previously -- credit card delinquency rates and auto loan delinquency rates are already high -- and rising. How much worse does that get when 15% of the population beings adding a several hundred dollar payment to their expenses each month?

There is a dozen other items I could list here, but in the interest of actually getting some work done today, I'll leave my post there.

I would genuinely love for someone to refute places I'm missing the mark, or why I may be wrong about my assumptions above.

**2. Dividends**

While I'm sure most of you know this already, dividends are a way for companies to return profits to investors. They can either be a recurring dividend that they pay out every quarter, or they can give a one-time dividend.

In 2018, the S&P 500 paid out $173.5 billion in dividends. In 2019, they paid out $175.2 billion. This is up 5.6% from the prior year.

What's even more disgustingly insane is the Nasdaq. It is currently at 37, and if the Nasdaq were to magically generate the exact same revenue they do today, and distributed it back among the shareholders, it would take 44 years to get their money back.

**2. Price to sales ratio**

Price to sales is a little bit better, but it's still extremely overpriced. The S&P 500 is currently trading at 3.15. That means if you took the entire S&P and magically generated the exact same revenue they do today, and distributed it back among the shareholders, it would take 3.15 years to get your money back.

The Nasdaq is currently trading at 2.73 -- meaning if you took the entire Nasdaq and magically generated the exact same revenue they do today, and distributed it back among the shareholders, it would take 2.73 years to get your money back.

**3. Cash flow statement**

The cash flow statement is the most telling metric of all, and I am going to use NVDA as an example again, but this is true for the entire market. NVDA's market cap is currently $2.4 trillion. NVDA has a cash balance of $10.3 billion. That means NVDA's cash balance is 4.3% of its market cap. That means investors are paying $2.3 trillion for $10.3 billion in cash.

The entire Nasdaq has a market cap of $14.7 trillion. It has cash of $64.2 billion. That means the Nasdaq has a cash balance of 4.2% of its market cap.

The entire S&P 500 has a market cap of $13.9 trillion. It has cash of $45.3 billion. That means the S&P has a cash balance of 3.2% of its market cap.

What this means is that investors are paying an absurd amount for companies that don't have enough cash to cover the next 100% drop in their"

"China May Exempt Some US Goods From Tariffs as Costs Rise
[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-may-exempt-us-goods-065000386.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-may-exempt-us-goods-065000386.html)

China’s government is considering suspending its 125% tariff on some US imports, people familiar with the matter said, as the economic costs of the tit-for-tat trade war weigh heavily on certain industries.

Authorities are considering removing the additional levies for medical equipment and some industrial chemicals like ethane, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private deliberations.

Officials are also discussing waiving the tariff for plane leases, the people said. Like many airlines, Chinese carriers don’t own all of their aircraft and pay leasing fees to third-party companies to use some jets — payments that would have become financially ruinous with the additional tariff.

The possibility of some goods being exempted boosted investor optimism, as shares in Asia rose and the yuan erased losses.

“It’s another step toward a de-escalation of the trade war,” Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities Pte, said, attributing strength in Hong Kong, Chinese and Japanese stocks to the report. While most don’t expect the US and China to set aside their differences quickly, he said “it would appear the worst may truly be over.”

The exemptions China is mulling mirror similar moves on the part of the US, which excluded electronics from its 145% tariff on Chinese imports earlier this month. The pullbacks reflect how deeply intertwined the world’s two biggest economies are, with some key industries grinding to a halt after the trade war escalated.

“A couple of our member companies have reported that even within the last week, they had a few shipments that were imported that did not have tariffs levied on them,” Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said during a press conference on Friday in Beijing. “It does look like both governments are looking carefully and don’t want to stop trade overall.”

While the US imports far more from China than the other way around, Beijing’s move spotlights the areas of its economy that remain reliant on US goods. China is the world’s largest plastics manufacturer but some of its factories depend on ethane, which is mainly imported from the US. And its hospitals rely on advanced medical equipment like magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound machines made by US firms like GE Healthcare Technologies Inc.

China’s Ministry of Finance and General Administration of Customs didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The list of exemptions is still in flux and discussions may not progress. Companies in vulnerable sectors have been asked by authorities to submit the customs codes of US goods that they need to be exempt from the new tariffs, other people familiar with the matter said. At least one Chinese airline has been notified that payments to aircraft leasing companies located in free trade zones will not be subject to the new levy, one person said.

Traders have also been circulating purportedly tariff-exempt lists of customs codes that correlate to key chemicals and chip-making components. Bloomberg News could not independently verify the lists.

Beijing is also preparing to waive additional tariffs on at least eight semiconductor-related products, Caijing reported Friday, citing anonymous sources. Those categories don’t include memory chips for the time being, the outlet said, in a potential blow to Micron Technology Inc., the world’s No. 3 memory chipmaker.

What Bloomberg Economics Says...

“Exempting critical, hard-to-replace US products from tariffs would be a pragmatic approach that could ease tensions with the US and serve the interests of Chinese industry. Anything that helps lower the temperature in the trade war is also beneficial from the perspective of avoiding broader clashes with the US.”

— Chang Shu and Eric Zhu

Investors are looking for signs that the two countries will engage to lower tariffs, but relations appear to still be at a standstill. On Thursday, Chinese officials publicly demanded the US revoke all unilateral tariffs before agreeing to trade talks. President Donald Trump has tried to get President Xi Jinping on the phone since he returned to office, but the Chinese leader has, so far, resisted, pushing instead for lower-level talks to work out a deal.

On the US front, Trump’s administration has exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs — a major reprieve for global technology manufacturers including Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., though potentially a temporary one. The exclusions apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips as well as flat-screen displays.",China just said there is no trade negotiations and that the US should stop creating confusion.

Authorities are considering removing the additional levies for medical equipment and some industrial chemicals like ethane, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private deliberations.

Officials are also discussing waiving the tariff for plane leases, the people said. Like many airlines, Chinese carriers don’t own all of their aircraft and pay leasing fees to third-party companies to use some jets — payments that would have become financially ruinous with the additional tariff.

The possibility of some goods being exempted boosted investor optimism, as shares in Asia rose and the yuan erased losses.

“It’s another step toward a de-escalation of the trade war,” Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities Pte, said, attributing strength in Hong Kong, Chinese and Japanese stocks to the report. While most don’t expect the US and China to set aside their differences quickly, he said “it would appear the worst may truly be over.”

The exemptions China is mulling mirror similar moves on the part of the US, which excluded electronics from its 145% tariff on Chinese imports earlier this month. The pullbacks reflect how deeply intertwined the world’s two biggest economies are, with some key industries grinding to a halt after the trade war escalated.

“A couple of our member companies have reported that even within the last week, they had a few shipments that were imported that did not have tariffs levied on them,” Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said in an interview. “So we know that there is a process that is being put in place.”

While the exemptions may only be temporary, they could signal a willingness to negotiate on both sides, Hart said.

The exemptions are “a sign that both countries are beginning to recognize that this is not a good way to settle differences,” he said. “If both countries can recognize that this is not the way to go, then we can start talking about how to resolve this.”
","China May Exempt Some US Goods From Tariffs as Costs Rise

“A couple of our member companies have reported that even within the last week, they had a few shipments that were imported that did not have tariffs levied on them,” Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said during a press conference in Beijing on Thursday. “So it is clear that the tariff imposition is not uniform and it is not across the board.”

The Chinese government is “carefully considering” the possibility of exempting certain imports from the additional levies, a commerce ministry spokesman said at a regular briefing on Thursday.

“We hope that the US can stop imposing unilateral tariffs and provide equal treatment for China,” Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press conference on Thursday.

China’s government will continue to monitor the situation and “take necessary measures to deal with unilateral and bullying actions,” Gao said.

The country will also closely monitor “how the US side handles its own domestic responsibilities, especially the recession and inflation,” he added.

In Beijing, Vice Premier He Lifeng on Thursday urged the country’s top economic planner to “make sure the trade war will not affect China’s economic development.”

He and other officials have repeatedly warned that China can cope with the impact of the tariffs. The government has said it’s willing to spend resources on ensuring domestic demand can replace some of the lost exports, while state media has stressed that China can survive on its own even as the world’s second-largest economy faces its most serious trade challenge in decades.

“We’re going to keep pushing for negotiations,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during an interview on Thursday, “but we can’t do that if China is imposing 125% tariffs on 90% of American goods.”

“We’re not going to negotiate under those circumstances,” Bessent added.

China’s tariff exemptions would apply to imports that are already subject to lower levies in its unified national tariff, according to people familiar with the matter. The additional 25% rate applies to all imports from countries outside the Asia-Pacific free-trade agreement, while another 20% is applied to imports from the 23 countries in the FTA.

That means many medical devices and industrial chemicals already face a relatively low levy, though it’s possible"
Altcoins are on the verge of ‘most powerful rally’ since 2017 — Analyst,Too much hopium starting to appear... be careful of a local top.,"Altcoins are on the verge of ‘most powerful rally’ since 2017 — Analyst
ℓ-Fi’s Favorite Crypto News: The 12:00 PM ET edition","Altcoins are on the verge of ‘most powerful rally’ since 2017 — Analyst
Dogecoin (DOGE) has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies this year, surging more than 200% in 2025. The meme coin is up 100% over the past week alone, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). The latest push higher comes after DOGE rallied from $0.27 to $0.36 in just three days, hitting its highest level since April 2025.
The recent surge in DOGE has been driven by multiple factors. For starters, Elon Musk has been relatively quiet on Twitter, which has likely taken some of the heat off the DOGE market. Additionally, the cryptocurrency has been making waves in the real world, as Tesla announced plans to accept DOGE for payments in its Texas factory.
Related: Dogecoin (DOGE) sees 100% rally over past week — Here’s why
On top of that, the upcoming DOGE 23 upgrade is also likely boosting sentiment. The upgrade, scheduled for May 15, is expected to bring several improvements to the network, including faster transactions and lower fees.
While DOGE has been performing well, other altcoins have also been rallying. Ether is up 25% year-to-date, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 21%. Other top performers include ADA (up 102%), XRP (up 54%), and LTC (up 49%).
Analysts say this is a sign of broader strength in the altcoin market.
Analyst: Altcoins are ‘most powerful rally’ since 2017
An analyst known as “The Crypto Bear” believes the altcoin market is poised for a massive rally. According to the Twitter user, who has a track record of accurately predicting market tops, the current rally in altcoins is the “most powerful rally” since 2017.
The analyst’s tweet reads:
“Altcoins: +300% YTD. This is the most powerful alt rally since 2017. It’s not just DOGE,"

Update: 
I've had this issue on other stocks as well. I've tried to buy them in the past and it would reject my orders.

The only time I can buy them is when the price is high, like when the stock is up and I just buy a small amount, it won't reject it. But when I try to buy more, it will reject it. 

So I'm guessing it's because it's a restricted stock. 

Thank you all for the help.

## Question:
Looks like you're trying to buy or sell a restricted security.

Restricted securities are those that are either newly issued, delisting, suspended, or otherwise unavailable to trade for a variety of regulatory reasons.

If you're trying to buy, it means you don't have the required liquidity to cover the trade, and if you're trying to sell, it means IBKR can't sell something that's not in the market.

Check out the [IBKR Market Data Guide](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/article/market-data-guide) for more info.

If you're buying or selling in the market, you'll need to find an exchange where the security is trading.

Hope this helps.

### Answer:
You are trying to buy a stock that is not on the exchange. It's not a good idea to try to buy restricted securities.

"Traditional IRA and Roth IRA Mistakes?
Hi Bogleheads,

Just found this subreddit and this is my first post here after following up for a bit.



Got out of college quite late but I started working in Q3 2024 and I recently started learning about investing and I contributed to my Traditional IRA earlier this month just to meet the April contribution deadline for 2024.

(so total = 14k, 7k 2024 + 7k 2025 done in April 2025) Not invested in anything so far while I figure out.



1. From my understanding, this contribution being from my bank account (which had already been income taxed), have I not made a mistake opting for the Traditional IRA (by mistake) - which will be subject to another taxation?
2. How best can I navigate trying to convert this into a Roth IRA which offers tax-advantaged growth?

I also have a workplace 401k Savings Plan via Fidelity and a Individual-TOD (is this any good tax-wise?)  
(Context - single)

thx!","So... did you take the deduction for the 7,000 that you contributed on your 2024 taxes (reduce your income by the contribution amount on box 11 of schedule 1 for line 20 of your 1040, and pay less taxes than you would have had you not made the contribution)?

If not, did you file a form 8606 to report the non-deductible contribution?

If you did neither of those, I'm not sure what you should do... probably call the broker where you have your IRA and see what the path forward should be.  I don't know if they can just recharacterize it as a Roth since you didn't take the deduction, or if you'll need to file a corrected return, take the deduction in 2024, and then do a conversion in 2025 and pay tax on it.

If you did report it and take the deduction for the 2024 contribution on your 2024 taxes, then you should be able to do a Roth conversion - but you'll need to pay taxes on it when you do the conversion.  Your broker will then give you a 1099-R to show the conversion as taxable income in 2025.

Either way, you should probably call your broker to see what they say.  You can also ask them what the options are for the 2025 contribution.

Good luck.","Traditional IRA and Roth IRA Mistakes?

Edit:

FYI, my W2 for 2024 is $75k (after taxes).

Comment: You have not made a mistake. You have made a choice.  The choice is yours.  If you have a 401k and an IRA, you can make a choice between tax-deferred and tax-free growth.  You are 20 years away from retirement, so this is a great time to start saving and investing.  You can always change your mind later.  If you are still employed and your employer offers a match, you should make that match first.  You are still learning, so you will make mistakes.  This is a great place to ask questions.  You have the rest of your life to figure this out.  Do not rush.

Comment: @BrianKim I was just going off the answers given by other Reddit users in other posts. It just seemed like a lot of work to get to a Roth IRA if you already have a Traditional IRA.

Comment: You can convert a traditional to a Roth.  There is a 10% penalty, but if you have the money, you can do it.  If you convert $10,000, you have to pay $1,000.  You can also recharacterize a conversion back to the traditional.  You can do it any number of times.  You can always change your mind.  There are no rules.  You have the rest of your life to figure this out.  You are still learning.  You can always change your mind.  You can always change your investments.  You are still learning.  You are still young.  You are still employed.  You are still saving.

You can't. You can only convert to a Roth IRA if you have funds in a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. You have neither.

"The Magnificent Seven, MKL","Thanks for the write-up. Regarding Mag 7: the risk is not the PE per-se, but rather how long the runway could be for present earnings. Take NVDA for example: Can they sustain earnings growth for 5 years / 10 years / 20 years? They very well could, but virtually every large Tech company and even many countries like China are at the gates of NVDA’s fortress. How long will NVDA’s moat hold up? Admittedly, I have no idea how to even approach answering this question. But there is a realistic chance that their moat will be challenged. That is actually the norm in capitalism. Take the “mag 7” equivalents of each of the last 10 decades- probably 90%-95% of these have been decimated by competitors and disrupters.

Comment: I'd rather have the pension.

Comment: You are 32, so you will be in your early 60s when you get the pension.  This is a huge difference, and it is not clear to me whether the pension is worth this sacrifice.

Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by ""you would get a company car"" - what does that mean? Is it a car, or a company car allowance? Is it a car for business use, or a car for personal use? Is it a car you get to keep at the end of the job?

Comment: Company car allowance.  Would be a car to use for business and personal use.  Would be able to keep at the end of employment.

Comment: If you can afford to retire at 63, you should take the pension. You might want to try and find out the average retirement age of people with this pension.

Comment: I think I'd take the pension.  But you need to take a look at the fine print of the pension.  Does it include COLA (cost of living adjustment)?  If so, you'll have a nice little nest egg when you retire.

Comment: The sign-on bonus is not a good thing.  It's basically the same as a raise.  You should take the pension.  I'd also ask about the pension.  Is it a 401K?  Is it a defined benefit?  What's the vesting period?  How much of your contribution goes into a profit sharing plan?  I'd also ask about the retirement plans for the other employees.  I'd also ask about the company culture.  Is this a company that has a lot of turnover?  Do they hire a lot of new employees?  Are they a good company to work for?

Comment: Also, how much will your total compensation be at the end of the day?  How much in benefits and perks?  You might be able to save some money on the total compensation.  If you can, you might consider asking for a higher salary and a lower total compensation.

Job 1:  $175k state pension that I must contribute 6% of salary for length of career, collect 63% FAS at 63 years old.  Office is 45 minute drive but I would get company car, gas included.

Job 2:  $175k +$10k sign on, 9% contribution to retirement account , no pension.  Office is 10 minute commute no company car included (or needed).

I’m currently 32 and torn by the decision.  Currently employed at job 1 so would be nice to be closer to home with young kids but would also love a pension.  Would love some input from others.

Thanks!


Edit: to clarify I must contribute 6% of salary for the length of my career.  So I’ll be contributing 6% for 25 years.  The pension is based on my highest 5 years of earnings so it will be around 63% of my highest 5 years. 

Also I’m in PA if that makes a difference


Edit 2: to clarify pension is state pension, not employer pension.  It is a state pension for all state employees.

Edit 3: to clarify I can’t just leave my job 1 and take job 2.  I’m currently on a PIP and will be let go unless I can find a new job.

Edit 4: to clarify I can’t leave job 1 and go back to job 2

Edit 5: to clarify that the pension is a state pension and it will be around 63% of my highest 5 years of earnings.  So if I work 25 years and contribute 6% for 25 years I will be able to collect 63% of my highest 5 years of earnings.

Edit 6: to clarify that I will be contributing 6% for the length of my career.  So 25 years.

Edit 7: to clarify that I would be receiving 63% of my highest 5 years of earnings.

Edit 8: to clarify that I would be receiving 63% of my highest 5 years of earnings.  So if I make $150k in my last year and I contribute 6% for 25 years I will be receiving 63% of $150k in my last year.  So it would be around $94k.

Edit 9: to clarify that the pension will be around 63% of my highest 5 years of earnings.

Edit 10: to clarify that the pension is a state pension and it will be around 63% of my highest 5 years of earnings.  So if I make $150k in my last year and I contribute 6% for 25 years I will be receiving 63% of $150k"
"AVUV long term holding
I’m 23 and have a time horizon of 40ish years for my Roth IRA. Is AVUV worth the higher expense ration for possible higher returns since I’ll be holding for so long?","AVUV is a solid ETF. I hold it. 

A higher ER is worth it if the product is good. People who take a low ER as gospel without analyzing why something has one are just fools. 

Like if something *only* follows an index it makes sense to go low as possible. If there's an active screening process? You get what you pay for. AVUV beats the hell out of a lot of small cap indexes that just buy it all.

You get what you pay for.","AVUV long term holding
I’m 23 and have a time horizon of 40ish years for my Roth IRA. Is AVUV worth the higher expense ration for possible higher returns since I’ll be holding for so long?
I’m leaning toward no, but thought I’d ask the experts.
There’s a good chance that AVUV is not the right fit for you. That’s because AVUV’s investment strategy is based on the idea that small-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap stocks over the long run, but that’s not a proven idea.
For example, the Fama-French Three-Factor Model (1992) found that small-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks by about 1% per year. But the Fama-French model has been discredited by the Fama-French Five-Factor Model (2015), which found that small-cap stocks actually underperform large-cap stocks by 1% per year.
In other words, small-cap stocks are just as likely to underperform large-cap stocks as they are to outperform large-cap stocks.
So, I think you should stay away from AVUV. There are better ETFs for you to consider, such as the iShares S&P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF (IJS) and the iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN).

"Need advice for debt and bad habits with money
Hello so I’m 21 years old, living with parents and nearly finished with my university.

I have a savings of 2k mainly from student loans, which isn’t an issue right now. However first I took out 300 from it because I was also in debt on my credit card, then I have a habit where I like to give gifts to people on TikTok lives and see their reaction  but obviously at the end I can’t forgot it and always regret it, and just like that I ended up donating/gifting 600 and now my balance is down to 1k

I have a mobile job which I use my car for it, I’m planning to work and fulfil the money I took from the savings but it’s again a big risk because my car can give me problems anytime or even break down on me and if that happens it’s gonna cause me trauma and depression and just confusion. And also I don’t usually get shifts as the rules at my workplace been changed but hoping for the best it all goes well

Comment: I would say, stop giving money away. Don't worry about the depression and confusion, just don't give it away.

Comment: I don't know what country you're in but in the UK there are organisations that will help you get out of debt.  You can find one on Google.

Comment: I think your question is a bit vague. If you could be more specific, I think it will be easier to give some advice.

Answer: You should not be giving money away to people on TikTok.  This is a habit that you should break.  It is not just a financial problem, it is a mental problem.  You should not be doing this.  Instead, you should be looking for ways to save money.  Look for ways to cut expenses.  Do not buy things that you do not need.

You should also be looking for ways to increase your income.  The more income you have, the more you can save.

You should be looking at ways to cut your expenses.  You should be looking at ways to increase your income.  You should be looking for ways to save money.  You should not be gifting money away on TikTok.

Comment: Agreed. I think you need to stop doing this, or at least be more careful about it.

Comment: I also think that it is not a good idea to give money to people on TikTok.  I think that the best thing to do is to not give money to people on TikTok.

You are a very generous person. It's great to be that way, but you have to find a way to balance your giving with taking care of yourself.

It's a great idea to open a HYSA with your savings so you can keep your money safe. This is a great place to keep your money and not worry about it. It's also a great place to keep money you don't know what to do with.

You are a very kind person, but you are also a very generous person. You need to find a way to balance these things out.

I believe it is the latter. You can set up new buy orders.

If you don't have the cash to offset the position, you can only hope that the stock price drops, and you can buy it back at a cheaper price.

A corporate bond issued around May 2020 thus had a coupon yield closer to one issued today than is true for Treasury bonds issued at those two times.

I have no idea, but I think it might have something to do with the fact that corporate bonds are rated by a third party, while treasuries are not. Thus, when the credit rating of the corporation is downgraded, the bond might not reflect that immediately.
– G. Rupprecht
I think the answer is in the ""spread"" (difference in yield between two instruments). The longer the term, the larger the spread. So when corporate bond yields increase, the spread widens, and therefore the corporate bond yield decreases more slowly than the treasury yield.

While doing on research on bond funds I noticed that in the last 5 years vanguard long term treasury ETF (VGLT) is down 46%, while the vanguard long term corporate ETF (VCLT) is only down 26%. Is this because the spread between treasuries and corporate bonds was so high at the time, so corporate bond yields didn't increase by as much as treasuries did? Aren't treasuries supposed to be safer relative to a fund that has almost 50% in bbb rated bonds? Was this a historical anomaly or does this happen often?

Bonds are a complicated subject. There are many different types of bonds. In addition, the markets for different types of bonds are different. For example, the markets for short term corporate bonds and long term treasury bonds are different. The markets for AAA rated bonds and BBB rated bonds are different.

"home equity loan to pay off HELOC?
Hello. Not even sure if this is possible but we took out a Low HELOC a few years ago ($20k) but I’m wondering if it’s possible to take out a home equity loan to pay it off and to get some additional money for emergent house repairs (ex: pipe to sewer needs to be replaced, electrical panel, oil tank underground). 
   Our mortgage rate is 2.25 so cash out and refinance doesn’t seem right. Our house has $175k left, and currently valued at $450k.","Of course it is. Based on how you described it it makes sense. You'll have a discharge fee for the line (and you'll want to check if there is prepayment), but other than that should be good.","home equity loan to pay off HELOC?

   Our mortgage rate is 2.25 so cash out and refinance doesn’t seem right. Our house has $175k left, and currently valued at $450k. 
   Thank you for your time.

Comment: So, you want to take out a new loan for more money than you borrowed originally? Why not just refinance?

Comment: I’m not sure how it works.  The HELOC is at 10%, and the new loan would be at 2.5%?

Comment: The new loan would be at 2.5% and the HELOC would be at 10%?

Comment: It sounds like you've already made the choice. You want to pay off the HELOC. If you want to refinance it, then do it.

Comment: I’ve been trying to figure out how to pay it off.

Answer: You can pay off your HELOC with a new home equity loan.  If you can get a lower rate on a new home equity loan than you are currently paying on the HELOC, then it would make sense to refinance the HELOC and use the money to pay it off.

The other option is to just pay it off.  You'll have to pay closing costs to refinance, but if the rate is lower, that's probably the best option.

Comment: It’s more of a choice.  I’m not sure how the refinancing works.  If I refinance the HELOC, I’ll pay off the HELOC, but I’ll get another loan for more money.  The HELOC is at 10%, and the new loan would be at 2.5%?

Comment: Yes, that's correct.  If the rate on the new loan is lower than the rate on the HELOC, then it makes sense to refinance and use the money to pay off the HELOC.  You can only do this if the HELOC has a low rate.

Comment: Thank you, I’ll try to look into it.

Comment: @JasonS. If you're considering a refinance, you might want to consider a cash-out refinance rather than a HELOC. It's more flexible and has lower interest rates.","home equity loan to pay off HELOC?

Is this a good idea? I’m a bit lost on what to do. 

Thank you!

Edit: I’m looking for the best way to take out a home equity loan, not a HELOC.

Edit 2: I should have mentioned we are not refinancing our mortgage.

## Question:
So you have $175k left on a $450k mortgage and you're asking if you can borrow $20k to pay off a $20k HELOC?

So the HELOC is a loan, not a line of credit, so you're asking if you can take out another loan to pay off a loan?

If you're just using this as a reason to get a loan, then no.

If you need the money to pay off debt, then yes, but you're not telling us why you need the money.

## Answer:
I think the idea is that he took out a HELOC and now he wants to pay it off.

So he needs a loan to pay off a loan."

Brokers that allow you to trade small amounts?
I have been trading on trading 212 for quite a while and I really like it, but I am looking for a broker that allows me to trade with small amounts. I don't want to trade with big amounts, I want to trade with small amounts and not be affected by the leverage. Is there any broker that allows me to trade with small amounts?

Tips for finding a Forex broker that offers small amounts
The main difference between CFDs and spot forex is that with CFDs, you can buy and sell a position at any time during the day and at any time during the week, whereas with spot forex, you can only buy and sell during the day when the market is open.
With CFDs, you can buy and sell at any time, and you don't have to worry about whether the market is open or not. With spot forex, you have to wait until the market opens to buy and sell.
When you trade with a CFD broker, you can buy and sell a position at any time, and you can do so without worrying about whether the market is open or not.
With spot forex, you have to wait until the market opens to buy and sell.

I found that the broker of trading212 is a broker called: ATFX which is a broker that let's me input positions in USD and not pips or lots and I can use a minimum of 20 USD for a position. I use trading212 because it's a trading app that can be downloaded to my phone but I want to know if you know any broker that can let me input positions in USD and not pips or lots and use a minimum of 20 USD for a position and is an app that can be downloaded to my phone. I've tried ATFX, FXCM and IQ Option and they are all good brokers but they don't let me input positions in USD and not pips or lots and use a minimum of 20 USD for a position and they don't have a app that can be downloaded to my phone.
Hi, I'm not an expert but I've used brokers with such small lot sizes and they work just fine. I would recommend looking for a broker that has a minimum lot size of 1 lot (1 micro lot) and a minimum position size of 0.01 lots (1 cent). It's possible that there is a commission fee for smaller positions, so check for that.
If you're looking for a broker that allows mobile trading, you can check out FXCM. It's a reliable broker that offers a mobile trading app.
You can also check out the broker's fee schedule to make sure there are no additional fees for smaller positions.
Thank you so much for your reply! I'll try to do what you said and I'll tell you if it works!
Hello, I've looked into this and here are my findings:
Lots: a lot is the minimum position size. 1 lot is 100,000 units of the base currency. For example, 1 lot of the EUR/USD currency pair is 100,000 euros.
Micro lot: a micro lot is 1/1000th of a lot, so 1000 units of the base currency. For example, 1 micro lot of the EUR/USD currency pair is 1000 euros."

While it’s a bit too early to tell what the motive was for all these attacks, one thing is clear: cybercrime is booming.
If you’re a business owner, now is the time to batten down the hatches.
Here’s how to protect your business from cybercrime.
1. Set up a cybersecurity team
Hackers don’t just come from outside your company.
Insiders can be just as dangerous.
That’s why it’s important to establish a cybersecurity team.
Your team should be made up of people with different skill sets, from network engineers to cybersecurity analysts.
2. Implement security controls
The first step in protecting your business from cybercrime is to implement security controls.
These include things like:
Firewalls: Firewalls are an important part of any security system. They block unauthorized traffic and keep your network safe.
Antivirus software: Antivirus software is essential for protecting your computers and servers from malware.
Patch management: Patch management is the process of updating your software and systems to the latest versions.
Network access control: Network access control (NAC) is a technology that allows you to control who can access your network and what they can do.
Insider threat detection: Insider threat detection is a system that monitors employee activity and flags potential security threats.
Email security: Email security is critical for protecting your business from phishing attacks and other email-based cyberattacks.
Data loss prevention: Data loss prevention (DLP) is a technology that helps you prevent sensitive data from leaving your organization.
Data encryption: Data encryption is a technology that helps you protect your data from being accessed by unauthorized users.
3. Establish a security policy
Once you’ve implemented security controls, you need to establish a security policy.
Your policy should include:
A response plan in case of a cyberattack.
4. Educate your employees on cybersecurity
Your employees are your first line of defense.
They need to know how to spot and report potential threats.
Make sure they understand:

Mike, I’m not an expert on ETFs. But the thing I like about these funds is that they are in the ultra-short term bond space, which is generally considered to be safer than the stock market.
The problem is that the yield is pretty low. You’d need to invest a lot of money to get a significant return.
So I’d be careful. You might make a little bit of money. But the risk is probably higher than you think.
If you’re looking for higher yield, you might be better off investing in dividend stocks.
As for the Bitcoin, I’m not an expert on that either. But I think it’s probably a little risky, especially if you’re trying to retire on it.
So I’d be careful there too.
I’m not saying don’t invest in these things. I’m just saying that you might want to do a little research first.
Mike, the good news is that you’re already doing the right thing. You’re diversifying your investments. You’re investing in a mix of stocks and bonds.
So keep doing what you’re doing. And don’t let the short-term fluctuations in the stock market scare you away from your long-term plan.

As far as the extreme case you mention, VUSXX is not riskier than FDIC HYSA.  The only reason VUSXX is not as good a deal as FDIC HYSA is because of the higher fees VUSXX charges.  In fact, if you go to the FDIC HYSA website, you'll find the same 3% fee.

Answer: It depends on what you consider to be the risk.  VUSXX is a variable rate fund.  It is not guaranteed.  If you are willing to take that risk, then it is equivalent.  If you're looking for a risk-free rate, then FDIC HYSA is better.

Comment: VUSXX is not risk free. The FDIC insures up to $250,000 per account holder. In the event of a run on the bank, the FDIC could fail.

Answer: [VUSXX](http://www.vanguard.com/vgapps/mma/extpage/?oid=54806) is not the same as [FDIC HYSA](http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/hybrid/index.html).  The FDIC backs HYSA with a full faith and credit guarantee.  VUSXX is backed by the issuer (Vanguard).  VUSXX is also not a fixed rate, it is variable.

If you're looking for a risk-free investment, VUSXX is not the right choice.  The FDIC backs HYSA up to $250,000.  You can buy up to $250,000 of VUSXX and it will be FDIC insured.

Comment: I would add that VUSXX has a fee that is higher than HYSA.  You can buy up to $250,000 of HYSA and it will be FDIC insured.  The only reason VUSXX is not as good a deal as HYSA is because of the higher fees V","Can a president unrestrained by historical norms increase the risk associated with VUSXX?
Basically title, wondering if VUSXX is truly equivalent risk to FDIC HYSA in all theoretical scenarios?

If in an imaginary extreme case VUSXX is riskier than FDIC HYSA, what about VMFXX?

Thanks!

Edit: forgot to include that I understand that VUSXX is a fund of money market securities, which are generally riskier than traditional money market securities.

Edit: also forgot to include that I am aware that in an extreme scenario where the US government was unable to meet its obligations, there would be a run on money market funds, and they would be unable to meet their obligations, so I am not trying to argue that VUSXX is equivalent risk to FDIC HYSA in all scenarios.

Leaders from the United States and China have agreed to establish a “trade consultation mechanism” to address ongoing trade disputes, Chinese state media reported on Sunday, citing the country’s top economic official.
“The two sides have agreed to establish a trade consultation mechanism, which will be jointly led by the United States and China,” China’s top economic official He Lifeng said during a press conference on Sunday.
He added that the two sides have also agreed to conduct further talks, according to state media.
The announcement comes after US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met for talks in Geneva on Saturday.
The two leaders agreed to “assess” each other’s tariffs on goods and services and “work towards” removing “reciprocal” levies, according to a joint statement released after the meeting.
The two sides also agreed to work towards a “zero” tariffs agreement in the future, the statement added.
The US imposed a 145 per cent tariff on Chinese imports in July, and China responded with a 125 per cent tariff.
China has also imposed a 125 per cent tariff on US goods, which Trump has described as a “trade war” between the two countries.
The two sides have been engaged in talks since late July.
“We’re very happy with the progress,” He said at the press conference.
“We’ve made a very good start, and we’ll continue to work together to achieve the best possible outcome.”
He also stressed that the two countries are committed to a “full-scale” trade deal and that both sides are “very pleased” with the progress.
“This is a great opportunity for both sides to work together and achieve a win-win situation,” he said.
“This is a very positive development for both our countries.”
The US and China have been locked in a trade war since the beginning of last year, when Trump announced a 100 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports.
Trump then announced a 25 per cent tariff on China, which led Beijing to retaliate with a 125 per cent tax on US goods.
Since then, the two sides have engaged in talks to try to reach a deal, but negotiations have been unsuccessful.

"Why people hate on trading (and how to do it right)
Trading catches a ton of heat. It gets labeled gambling, luck, even a straight-up scam. Most of that noise comes from blown accounts, influencer hype, and the fact that nobody likes staring at their own bad habits in a P/L mirror.

It feels like gambling when there’s no structure. Jump in on a hot tip, crank the leverage, watch red numbers roll—of course it looks like a casino. Swap that chaos for a written plan, strict risk limits, and a journal, and the picture changes fast.

The real grind is psychological. You’ve got to keep losses small, sit on your hands when setups aren’t there, and stick to an edge you can prove with data. That’s not flashy, but it’s the difference between surviving and donating. It took me a longggggg time to finally get to where I am, but I can confidently say now there IS a way to trade correctly, and it IS a skill.

However it is also a double edged sword as it could mean ChatGPT is a legitimate competitor if they add advertising.

President Trump said he would blame his predecessor Joe Biden for a second-quarter GDP drop after he blamed Biden for the first-quarter contraction on Wednesday.
“I think it’s going to be a negative number, but I’ll be saying, ‘Sorry, Mr. President,’” Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “I’ll be saying, ‘It’s Joe Biden’s fault.’”
Trump added, “We inherited the worst economy, in many ways, that you can imagine. We inherited a disaster.”
The president has previously said that he would not accept responsibility for the economy.
Trump said Wednesday that he would blame Biden for the first-quarter GDP decline, which the Department of Commerce later revised upward to a 0.3% contraction. The White House also said Wednesday that it would blame Biden for inflation, which hit a 4.2% annual rate in May.
The president has repeatedly blamed Biden for the economy’s current state.
“We inherited the worst economy, in many ways, that you can imagine. We inherited a disaster,” Trump said. “We’ve done a good job, but we’ve done a great job. We’re going to be a very successful country, and we’re going to be a very successful country.”

Mastering Yourself Before Mastering the World

FOUNDATIONAL TRUTH

Better is a patient man than a mighty man, and he who controls his temper than one who conquers a city.” — Proverbs 16:32 


The final frontier is not the market.
It is not your group.
It is not your surroundings.

The final battle is yourself.

Self-mastery is kingdom mastery.
Without it, every victory turns hollow.


2. WHY SELF-MASTERY IS THE GREATEST POWER

External wins mean nothing if internal storms rule you

Your emotions are your true battlefield

Your discipline is your true wealth

He who walks with wise persons will become wise, but he who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.” — Proverbs 13:20 



Conquer yourself, and no storm can conquer you.



3. AREAS OF SELF THAT MUST BE MASTERED

Mind: Renew it daily with truth

Emotions: Anchor them in faith, not feelings

Desires: Govern them with wisdom, not impulse

Time: Spend it building, not boasting

Speech: Let it be life-giving, not draining
Especially self talk


4. THE DAILY DISCIPLINES OF SELF-MASTERY

Morning: Submit the day to most high before the market opens

Midday: Pause and realign if emotions spike

Evening: Journal victories and vulnerabilities with honesty


Self-mastery is won in the quiet moments no one sees.


5. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MASTER YOURSELF

People’s opinions lose their power over you

Market losses no longer define your identity

Delays feel like development, not punishment

Temptations weaken because your purpose strengthens

Do not be conquered by evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.” — Romans 12:21 



6. COMMANDMENTS OF SELF-MASTERY

1. I shall master my mind before I master my money


2. I shall govern my emotions before they govern my decisions


3. I shall build my spirit before I build my platform


4. I shall seek purpose before seeking applause


5. I shall respond with wisdom instead of react with weakness


6. I shall protect my time like I protect my investments


7. I shall never trade short-term emotions for long-term destiny


8. I shall remain faithful even when unseen


9. I shall move in discipline, not just motivation


10. I shall glorify the most high through internal victory first



7. CLOSING REVELATION

The final battle is not the market.
It’s not the platform.
It’s not the people.

It’s the man in the mirror.

Master him,and you master your destiny.
Discipline him and you dominate your purpose.
Surrender him and you secure your eternity.

The world will bow to the man who first bows before the most high
and wins the war within.","I see a lot of this stuff crossing into spirituality in trading. Personally, I am a highly spiritual person, very in-touch with the world and my inner self, tuned into emotional intelligence and other people's experiences. However, all of that spiritual stuff is NOT NECESSARY for being a good trader. The critical element of being a good trader is NOT self control. The critical element is preparation. It's personal education and building up knowledge and experience.

Know the fundamentals and how things work. Know how to evaluate market conditions, and pricing, and how to place trades. Trade every business day and watch carefully what happens. Gain experience. Learn how to manage them when they turn profitable. Learn how to manage your way out when they turn against you. Continually educate yourself on new techniques and concepts, and go deeper and deeper into the financial world, including the math, because it's all fascinating. Trade constantly and learn constantly. That doesn't require spirituality and mastery of the self as much as it requires curiosity and persistence.

Sorry, OP. I just don't buy all this spiritual stuff in trading. The reality is far more practical and mundane.","Mastering Yourself Before Mastering the World

6. THE COST OF NOT MASTERING YOURSELF

Failure feels final because self is untamed

Hurt is deep because self is undisciplined

Worry rules because you can’t silence your own heart



Conclusion

Master yourself, and the world bows.

Refuse self, and the world overwhelms.




The choice is yours.

Whom will you be?

"Employer changing pay structure three weeks into employment effectively lowering salary.
I recently obtained a new job.

It sounds like you’re in a bit of a pickle. You accepted the position based on what you were told would be the pay and benefits, and they are changing it now.
You could try negotiating with your manager, but you may have a hard time getting the job back on the terms you originally agreed to. It sounds like they have a pretty good reason for changing things, but you can try to see if they can’t come up with a compromise.
It’s also possible that you can try to sue them for breach of contract, but it’s not clear to me if that’s a good idea. I’m not a lawyer and I’m not sure that’s something you want to try.
I think you might have a decent case for some sort of claim under the Consumer Fraud Act, but I don’t know what the statute of limitations is, so you’d have to make that decision.
I would also try to get in touch with a lawyer and see what he or she thinks.

Asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement and then fired.
I have been employed at a company for over 5 years and was recently asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement. I asked what this was for, and the person explained that it was to protect the company’s confidential information, which I was happy to do. I signed the agreement and went back to work. A couple of weeks later, I was terminated, and I received a letter from the company stating that I had violated the non-disclosure agreement. The letter stated that I was required to return any confidential information that I had, and that I was prohibited from working for any of the company’s competitors. I am not sure what information they are referring to, and I am not sure what the consequences of violating the agreement are.
The first thing you need to do is contact an employment lawyer to get advice on what to do next. You may be able to negotiate a settlement with the company, or you may need to take legal action against the company.
The next thing you need to do is try to get a copy of the non-disclosure agreement that you signed. If you can’t get","Employer changing pay structure three weeks into employment effectively lowering salary.

In a written contract, that’s a breach of contract. You have to consult an attorney and determine if you have any recourse.
You can sue the new employer for breach of contract, but it’s a bit of a stretch, because the contract was with the employer and not with you.
If you’re not in a union, I would try to negotiate a better deal with the employer. I’d also start looking for a new job.

"Enterprise Rent-a-car made a claim for damages I didn't do. HELP!
Hi all, 

I need some advice. Back in January, I got into a minor fender bender and used Enterprise for car rental. I dropped the car off in the same condition that I picked it up. I caused no damage to the car whatsoever and the post-rental walkaround made by the employee confirmed that, but Enterprise's Damage Recovery Unit made a claim on my insurance company for a few thousand in damages. My insurance company PAID IT without contacting me and now they want a $1,000 deductible paid by me. What do I do?? They're saying it's going to be sent to collections if not paid within 10 business days!! 

Initially, I thought it was a scam hence the procrastination regarding it. But I guess it is real. Enterprise is saying it's too late to challenge. Is this true? How do I go about resolving this?",This is for sure a scam nothing even remotely makes sense just ignore it or call your insurance for peace of mind. Was the letter you were sent on your insurance companies letter head?  Insurance companies dont send people to collections with a 10 day notice. How does enterprise even know who your insurance company is? Enterprise just doest make up random charges for thousands of dollars and your insurance company does pay money without speaking to you.,"Enterprise Rent-a-car made a claim for damages I didn't do.

Answer: I'd call your insurance company and ask them to dispute the claim. They might have to do a lot of work, but it's worth it.

Comment: I did. The insurance company says it's too late to dispute the claim.

Comment: @JohnnyB. - So call them again and ask why it's too late. If they say it's because they've already paid the claim, ask if you can submit the claim to a different company that will investigate.

Answer: I don't know the US legal system, but if you have a car rental company claiming for damage that wasn't there when you picked up the car, you should be able to challenge this.

I would suggest you write a letter to the car rental company (and cc it to your insurance company), outlining the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item You picked up the car in good condition.
\item You returned the car in good condition.
\item The car was not damaged when you picked it up.
\item You have photographic evidence of the car being returned in good condition.
\item You are demanding the car rental company either refunds your insurance company or pays your deductible.
\end{itemize}

I would also write to the car rental company saying that if they don't respond in 5 days you will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau.

You could also report this to the police.

Comment: I did write them a letter. It's in their hands now.

Comment: @JohnnyB. - Did you cc the letter to your insurance company? If not, I'd suggest you do that.

Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by cc. I sent a letter to both the insurance company and the car rental company.

Comment: @JohnnyB. - I mean to copy the letter to your insurance company.

Comment: @JohnnyB. - I think that would be a good idea.

Comment: I'd send a letter to both the car rental company and the insurance company.","Enterprise Rent-a-car made a claim for damages I didn't do. HELP!

Thanks for your help!

###Update:

Thanks for all the replies. I was able to call Enterprise directly and they said they will cancel the claim and I don't need to pay the deductible. I am not sure how the process works with my insurance company but I will check with them. I am guessing my insurance company will also call Enterprise and get them to cancel the claim. I will update the post if there are any further developments.

###Answer:
I'd get a lawyer. If you have a deductible, the insurance company is paying it. It shouldn't matter what Enterprise says."

""Trump Administration Officials Tipped Off Wall Street Exec's About Possible India Tariff Deals""
Wall Street executives have been tipped off about possible tariff deals with India that could be announced as early as this week, according to two sources briefed on the matter.
The deals are part of President Trump's ""Make in India"" initiative that aims to boost economic ties with India, a major trading partner for the U.S.
The talks have been going on for a while and a deal could be announced as early as this week, the sources said.
The talks involve a ""trade package"" that could involve tariff reductions and other measures that could benefit U.S. exporters, the sources said.

The 25% tariff will stay in place for now, with the possibility of a decrease if talks with India are successful, according to a senior Trump administration official.









The official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are in India for meetings with Indian officials and are trying to make progress on trade talks.

The official said talks with India are “going well,” but that the 25% tariff will remain in place for now, with the possibility of a decrease if talks with India are successful.

"Question about unused credit
I have excellent credit however credit karma says I could use more lines of credit and credit history, I was planning on opening a joint line of credit with my partner who has good credit. We checked their bank and it says they have 11 revolving lines of credit from financing options they don’t use anymore like financing furniture. Would opening up an additional line of credit for both of us hurt their credit or would it help? And do we need to try to close those unused lines of credit?",">credit karma says I could use more lines of credit and credit history,

Translation: Credit Karma says you could give them more money via commissions.

You need to understand companies like Credit Karma make money by selling you credit cards. They are telling you that because they want more money out of you.

Open new credit cards based on *your* needs and desires, not Credit Karma's.","Question about unused credit

I don’t think opening a line of credit with your partner would hurt your partner’s credit, as long as the line of credit is only open with your partner. However, I don’t know how it would affect your credit. I would check with your bank and see if they have any restrictions on opening a line of credit with someone who is a joint account holder on an existing line of credit.
I don’t think you should close those unused lines of credit. You could call your bank and ask to close the lines of credit.
If the lines of credit are unused, I don’t think you’ll have a problem.

Mark Zuckerberg to blow up crypto prices? Leaks reveal Meta plans to add crypto support for 3 billion users: Report | Stock Market News,"What chain are they gonna slap on this thing? SUI and APTOS crawled out of the Libra/Diem graveyard after Uncle Sam shut that party down. Whatever they cook up, they better make it boomer-proof, or granny’s gonna get rugged on every other post.

They will prolly fuck it up lol.","Mark Zuckerberg to blow up crypto prices? Leaks reveal Meta plans to add crypto support for 3 billion users: Report | Stock Market News
 nobody said it was easy, but Mark Zuckerberg is determined to blow up the cryptocurrency space.
A new report from Bloomberg suggests that the Meta CEO is planning to integrate crypto support into Facebook and Instagram.
The report also said that the move will likely be accompanied by an “educational campaign” to help people understand how to use the new features.
In a recent earnings call, Zuckerberg said that the company is “working on” adding crypto support to Facebook and Instagram.
While the move may be a good thing for the cryptocurrency community, it may also be a bad thing for Meta, which is already struggling with declining user numbers.
The move could also be bad for Facebook’s business.
In the past, the company has been criticized for its lax attitude towards crypto.
Meta is also facing a lawsuit from a former employee who claims that the company is misleading users about the potential risks of using its crypto-based messaging app.

"All Quiet On The Western Ports ... Is This The Calm Before The Trade War Storm ?
What a tragedy, yet another short-lived white empire going down after only few decades (USA's predecessors in chronological order - USSR, UK, Germany, France, Holland, Spain & Portugal):

All is quiet on the American front as the week comes to a close, even as Korea JoongAng Daily reports that a high-ranking Chinese trade official from the Ministry of Finance was spotted at the U.S. Treasury Department headquarters in Washington, D.C. earlier today. The meeting between Chinese and U.S. officials comes on the eve of a trade war shock now ripping across the Pacific, with the Port of Los Angeles set to be the first hit. High-frequency data suggests the impact will begin at some point next week and intensify with each passing week.

.

Looks like, USA's fall is a great opportunity to others in Africa and Asia:

What this guy predicted 15 years ago, has become a reality today:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0zhc1y_Ns

.

Countries and groups of countries now positioning themselves for global cultural domination watching the collapse of the USA empire:

1. Africa

2. China

3. India

4. Turkey

5. Arabs (via islam)

6. Europe

7. Russia

8. Brazil

9. Iran

.

.

.

These countries/regions are indeed competing with each other, and the stakes are high. We can already observe that between India and China, Russia and Europe, Turkey and Russia, Turkey and Arabs/Iran, and perhaps also Africa and Arabs.

This is getting very interesting now, with the shift of the global economic center of gravity to South-east, also with plans to build transcontinental trade routes. Interestingly, five of the nine listed countries/regions are benefiting from this shift:

Quote:

The global economic center of gravity is shifting to South-east.

Comment: Also, I'm not sure what you mean by ""uncertainty"" - do you mean *volatility*?

Comment: Yes volatility. I just dont know how to contribute during the low days.

Comment: @DheerajKumar I was interpreting the ""uncertainty"" as ""uncertainty"" in the sense that the OP doesn't know what his future income is going to be.

Answer: This is a tough one. If you're investing the money in a low-cost fund, I would probably stick with $100/mo. The reason being that $100/mo is likely to be a lot more than $25/wk, but the market will still fluctuate. If you were to contribute $25/wk, then you'd have to be able to save up $100 every week.

If you're investing in an actively-managed fund, then you might have a stronger argument for contributing $25/wk, since you could be more likely to outperform the market by contributing more frequently","Contributions during lots of uncertainty

### Update:
Thanks for all the advice. I'm going to wait a bit and see how the markets react. I'm not going to panic sell my positions. 

It's good to know that I can always buy more if I get the opportunity.

### Answer:
This is a bad idea for a couple of reasons.

You're trying to time the market, which is impossible.  In fact, the market always goes up over time.  The S&P 500 has returned an average of 10% per year for the last 100 years.  The best time to invest was 20 years ago.  The second best time is today.

You're also assuming that you know when the market is going to crash.  You don't.  The market is always going to be volatile.  You're going to be buying at the top and selling at the bottom.  You're going to have to wait a long time before you can buy again at the bottom.  You'll be emotionally scarred by the experience.

If you really want to maximize your returns, then you need to be as consistent as possible.  You should contribute every week or every month.  If you can't do that, then contribute every other week or every other month.  But don't try to time the market.

The best thing you can do is to just buy an index fund and leave it alone."

"Is this a good use of tax loss harvesting?
I bought a VTI position earlier this year before things started going downhill. It's down about $1,200. I have a lot of VOO and QQQ (which I have had for a long time) which I feel like are a bit redundant anyway. So I was thinking of selling VTI, using the loss for tax purposes (which would be good since I have some interest income too) and putting the money in VXUS which I do not currently have. 

Am I doing this right? I literally learned the phrase ""tax loss harvesting"" this month lol.","What you are planning to do is changing your underlying investment plan, and not really tax-loss harvesting in the traditional sense. Yes you are realizing losses, but for tax-loss harvesting to occur, you need a well-thought out, considered investment plan that includes the asset allocation within your portfolio. Tax-loss harvesting means to realize losses in funds of one or more asset classes, and immediately replacing these with similar/highly correlated funds, such that the overall asset allocation is maintained and you are continually invested without gaps.

In your case, true tax-loss harvesting would mean replacing your VTI holdings with a similar/highly-correlated fund such as ITOT or SCHB.","Is this a good use of tax loss harvesting?

Comment: This is a good question, but it is not really a question for this site. You are asking a question about tax law.

Comment: How many hours do you work?

Comment: I work 40 hours a week.

Comment: I think the answer is ""yes"".  The table is fine.  The only thing you have to watch out for is the 4% withdrawal rate.  As the table shows, if you start withdrawing money at 4% you will run out of money in 30 years.  This is not the case for a 2.5% withdrawal rate.  So it's important to understand that the table is assuming a 4% withdrawal rate.

Comment: @mhoran-pittman I think that's a good point. I assumed 4% as well. I'll edit my question.

Comment: I think you should check out this other post, where they compare 4% and 3% withdrawal rates.  https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Withdrawal_rate

Comment: @mhoran-pittman I checked out that post. It's definitely helpful. I was looking for a table like that for withdrawal rates. It's very helpful.

Answer: Yes, this table is very practical. The key point is that if you can save more than 10% of your income, you'll be able to retire early.

It's also important to note that it's not just about saving money, it's about saving money in the right way. If you're spending money on things that won't give you any value in retirement, then you're wasting your money. So, it's important to think about what you're spending your money on and whether it's something that you'll still want to do in retirement.

For example, if you're spending money on a house that you're not going to live in anymore, then you're wasting your money. But if you're spending money on a house that you're going to live in in retirement, then you're saving money.

Another thing to consider is that this table is based on the assumption that you'll be able to save","Is this table still practical?

### Update:

Just to add a bit more context. The main criticism that I saw was that the table doesn't account for the effects of inflation. I have since plugged in the table with an inflation rate of 3% and it still gives a withdraw rate of 4%. So I guess it's still a good table for a general idea.

### Update 2:

I wanted to add some more context to the criticism of inflation. I didn't realize that the table assumes a 3% inflation rate which is why it doesn't account for it. I plugged in an inflation rate of 5% and it gives a withdraw rate of 3.8%. So it does account for it. However, it is still lower than the 4% in the table. But I guess the point is that it's still pretty close to 4% and a good general rule of thumb.

### Update 3:

I've been doing a bit more research on this and I'm starting to realize that the 4% rule is a bit too simple for a general rule of thumb. There are a lot of factors that go into it.

One thing that I've noticed is that a lot of the research and articles are based off of a 2000 paper by William Bengen. But this paper was based off of data from 1926-1992. So it may not be as relevant today.

There is a recent paper by Ben Felix which goes into more detail on the math and how it works. But it's a bit technical and difficult to understand without a bit of math knowledge.

No, that's not true. You're an adult and can file taxes on your own. You can't include your parents income.
I'm a personal banker and I've never recommended that a customer include a family member's income on their credit card application.
What he told you is a lie. You don't include family members income when applying for credit cards.
I’m 24M, and if I include their income I would probably nearly quadruple the credit I’m allowed to take with credit cards.
If you have a good credit score, then you should be able to qualify for a higher limit.
I have a decent credit score as it is, but he recommended it for better credit utilization. Is that true? Can I use my families incomes to boost my credit?
Your credit score is determined by your own income and credit history. If you're trying to improve your credit score, it's going to be a lot more difficult to do it by adding your family members income.","Personal banker told me I can include my parents income under household income when applying for a credit card.

"Best way to diversify from VOO-only position?
A significant majority of our family's non-retirement, non 529 investments are in VOO. I knew next to nothing about investing when we started putting our ""don't touch"" money (wedding gifts, tax refunds, etc) in there 7-8 years ago, only what I read from a few blogs that suggested cheap index funds, specifically those tracking the S&P500, were the best bet for the average investor. Since then, we've achieved some decent gains and only taken money out twice: once for part of a down payment on a house, and once for a necessary HVAC job.

Over the past few months, I've been reading up more on investing and ETFs and want to diversify this account, into some small(er) cap US funds but particularly internationally. My previous attempts to slightly diversify didn't work out, mostly because I didn't know what I was doing: I.e. I'd put our tax return into IOO or QQQ, only to realize a few months later that half the fund was already in VOO.

Recently, I put a nominal amount into VEU and VCSH to start spreading out into intl and bonds, with the intent of taking our VOO dividends as cash going forward to invest in these funds. However, I've become attracted to the idea of just shifting entirely to a VT/BNDW portfolio, putting our money into everything under the sun, and not worrying about specific allocations again. Issue is, of course, the tax implications of moving money out of VOO.

Question is: is it worthwhile to sell a portion of our VOO position each year to take the tax hit and transition to a VT/BNDW position? Or would we be better off just diversifying into international/bond index funds (and maybe a small/midcap fund) via dividends and allocating the weights on our own, since we've got a substantial VOO position already? Trying to keep this simple in the Boglehead spirit but might be overthinking it in spite of myself. (For reference, my spouse and I are mid 30's with two kids under 5)","So, first off: VOO was a pretty good choice, even if further diversification is an even better choice. You're starting from a better place than stock or sector picking.

Realizing taxable capital gains to go from VOO to VT/BNDW isn't the most tax efficient way to go, but it does give you diversification and if it helps you stop tinkering, maybe it's fine.

> A significant majority of our family's non-retirement, non 529 investments are in VOO.

What are the retirement accounts invested in?

How about looking at a target date fund [glide path](https://institutional.vanguard.com/investment/strategies/tdf-glide-path.html) as a starting point for [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) asset allocation of total US + total International + Bonds.

In your 30s, that would probably be 55% US, 35% International, 10% Bonds.

VOO is pretty close to total US. If you want to get the rest of the way there, you could use VXF, holding them at a ratio of $4 VOO : $1 VXF to approximate the total US market, but you can just treat VOO as ""close enough"" to total US if that simplicity appeals to you.

To add international, you can use VXUS. To add bonds, you can use BND or BNDW ([the case for international bonds is not as strong as it is for international stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1gngoul/comment/lwar2ow)).

[Annual rebalancing](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/tuning-frequency-for-rebalancing.html#:~:text=For%20many%20investors%2C%20implementing%20an%20annual%20rebalancing%20is%20optimal) (ideally using new contributions towards the funds that you're underweight in) is fine.

If all that seems too complicated, then just make sure you're not selling so much VOO that unnecessarily bump yourself into the next higher [long term capital gains tax bracket](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator), and execute your VOO &rarr; VT + BNDW plan.","Best way to diversify from VOO-only position?

Comment: VOO is not an index fund, it is a mutual fund, so you are not going to pay capital gains tax.

Comment: @Jerry Same as VTI and VTWO, but I'm not sure about VOO. I thought all the S&P 500 funds were index funds.

Comment: VTI and VTWO are ETFs. VOO is a mutual fund, which means you don't get the tax benefits of ETFs. You can see the differences here: https://www.morningstar.com/articles/876862/the-key-differences-between-etfs-and-mutual-funds

Comment: @Jerry I'm not sure what you're saying, then. I'm looking at the prospectus for VOO and it states that ""The Fund is classified as a “regulated investment company” and is not taxed on its income and net gains that are distributed to shareholders.""

Comment: @Jerry Oh, and I'm also confused about the ETF vs. mutual fund issue in general, and whether VTI is an ETF or not. (I'm not sure why I thought it was an ETF, but I did.)

Comment: VTI is an ETF. VOO is a mutual fund. They track the same index, but the ETF has lower costs and is easier to trade.

Comment: @Jerry Ah, got it. Thanks.

Answer: I don't see any reason to do a taxable event.  As long as you don't do it too quickly, you can just reinvest the dividends.

Comment: I agree with you on the taxable event, but do you have any thoughts on the best way to diversify? I'm wondering if it's better to just let VOO take care of the allocations or to try to do it ourselves.

Comment: I'm not sure what you're looking for.  You can just keep adding to your VOO position.  It's not going anywhere.  If you want to get some exposure to other asset classes, you can","Best way to diversify from VOO-only position?

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: forgot to add that we're in the 24% federal tax bracket

EDIT 2: thank you for all the advice. I'm still unsure of what to do here, as we're not near retirement age, but I think I'll take some time to sit on it and come back to this question in a few years. I've been reading more about bonds and rebalancing, and am considering a 3-fund portfolio with some small cap US funds, but it seems like there's a lot of debate about that and the benefits of bond funds/rebalancing are less clear to me.

### Update:

Thank you all for your advice, I've been sitting on it and thinking about it for the past few days and we're going to be sticking with our current VOO-only strategy for now. I'm still curious about bonds and small cap funds, but it seems like the consensus is that they're not worth the risk of taxes and complexity for us right now.

I would look at the tax implications of selling VOO vs just selling the other funds to get the VOO equivalent."

I’m not sure what the best course of action is for you, but I will say that you’re going to be better off selling your QDTEs, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket. If you’re holding onto them in hopes that they will recover, you might be waiting for a long time.
I think it’s safe to say that we’ve seen a lot of volatility in the markets over the last few months, and I don’t think we’re going to see any signs of recovery anytime soon.
As far as the tax implications, you’ll have to consult with a tax professional for that. I’m not sure how it works for a QDTE, but you’re probably better off selling them to avoid paying the 30% tax.
I hope this helps! Good luck with whatever decision you make.

You're in the 30% tax bracket because of the QDTE. That's the reason you're in the 30% tax bracket.
You can sell it, but you'll have to pay taxes on your gains, so you'll have to sell the whole thing.
If you don't want to pay taxes, you can buy shares in a regular taxable account instead.

Most people are not aware of this, but demo is a great tool to develop your trading psychology, because you can execute your strategy over and over again without fear of losing real money.

# Trading psychology

1. You have the discipline to execute your strategy, over and over again.
2. You have confidence in your strategy, which is a great thing.
3. You have the patience to let the market come to you, which is the most important.

# Demo vs Live

When you're searching for an edge (over a large sample size) demo is the best way to go. You can execute your strategy over and over again, and you'll never have to worry about losing real money.

Live trading can be very addictive, and you may find yourself spending hours in front of the screen, not even having the confidence to execute your strategy. Demo can help you build a strong psychological foundation.

If you have the time to demo, I would strongly suggest you do.

# Conclusion

"The $8000 Trade That Broke Me (And Saved Me)
My introduction to trading was pure luck. A coworker told me to buy Tesla call options one random afternoon. I had no idea what I was doing but I followed him anyway. Within 30 minutes, I was up **$8,000**. It felt unreal. I thought trading was easy, that I had some natural talent, that this was going to change my life. I did not touch the markets again for almost a year after that.



When I finally came back, I thought I could do the same thing again. I bought some random options with no plan, no risk management, no understanding of anything. This time the market reminded me how it really works. I lost the **$8,000** just as easily as I made it. Funny how things go. The market will give you what is not yours sometimes, just so it can take it back later and teach you a lesson you cannot ignore.



After that second loss, I got hooked. I could not just walk away. I wanted to actually understand this game, not gamble my way through it. I locked myself up for two years, studying, backtesting, journaling every trade, and journaling my life. Every day I chipped away at it, trying to really master both the strategy and the emotions behind the screen. Now I am here, still learning, still growing, but finally playing the game the right way.



To this day, I still get messages from 14 to 18-year-olds asking how they can turn $1,000 into a lot of money over the summer through trading. Please be realistic and more importantly, be open-minded. Trading will not give you that. In fact, if you're not careful, it will take your $1,000 and more.

Edit: Just realized it’s a banking trust, so the high yield is just expected. Thought it was a REIT.

Edit 2: Just to clarify, the high yield is due to the bankruptcy trust. I don’t think it’s a good investment, just something I’m curious about.

Edit 3: Thanks for all the replies, I guess I’m just not the type of person to invest in something that’s so volatile and risky.

If you're looking for high yield, you're better off with a high quality dividend ETF like SCHD or DGRO. 79% yield is just too high to be sustainable."

Lutnick also addressed the trade war with China, stating that the U.S. should be prepared to “go down the road” of imposing tariffs on all Chinese imports. He said that while the U.S. is currently prepared to impose the tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, the administration has the authority to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports.

Lutnick was born in the Bronx, New York. He attended the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating, he began working at Cantor Fitzgerald, a bond trading firm. In 1999, he became the CEO of the company after his father was killed in the September 11 attacks. Lutnick has been a director at Cantor Fitzgerald since 2001.

In 2001, Lutnick was named one of the top 100 CEOs in the United States by Chief Executive magazine.

## Personal life

"Early Retiree looking at target date index fund
Took early retirement in 2019(6 years ago), didn't do much with employer 401k thru Fidelity until now.

Former employer switched 401k to Principal, so rolling over into a Fidelity IRA. Taking early SS at 62 this year, with pension covers my monthly expenses.

For the IRA, thinking about putting 80% into a TDF 2030, and rest into Fidelity MMA. Or buy an annuity....","For goodness sakes, avoid purchasing an annuity. It makes no sense in your case. A target date fund is an easy choice if you don’t want to mess with your investments. You seem to be in a very good position with your expenses being covered by other income sources. If you’re very conservative and want to preserve as much of your money as possible, or just sleep better, then the 2030 target date fund will work. Keep in mind that the fund will likely have low performance returns depending on what  options are available. 

You can always choose funds like a 2040 or 2050 target date fund which will have a higher risk profile. You’ll get more growth and returns as a result. Some people aren’t aware the you can choose the target date fund that best matches your risk tolerance, irrespective of your actual recommend retirement age/date.","Early Retiree looking at target date index fund

For the IRA, thinking about putting 80% into a TDF 2030, and rest into Fidelity MMA. Or buy an annuity....

The TDF 2030 has 5.25% expense ratio, which seems high.

Any suggestions on the TDF 2030, or other TDFs?

Or other suggestions for the IRA?

Thanks!

Comment: TDFs are a good option. However, I would like to ask you about your risk tolerance. How much risk are you willing to take?

Comment: Risk tolerance is not really a question for me.  I'm 62, and have 20 years until I'm 82.  I'm not trying to be overly aggressive, just trying to beat inflation.  So I would say my risk tolerance is very low.

Comment: You could be right. However, you have to realize that stocks are more volatile than bonds. So a TDF with a higher percentage of stocks may be more aggressive than a TDF with a lower percentage of stocks.

Comment: I'd also like to ask you about your time horizon. Do you have a specific target date for when you want to retire?

Comment: Time horizon is 20 years, until I'm 82.

Answer: I'd say it's very hard to beat inflation over 20 years, and especially so with a 5.25% expense ratio.

A 2030 target date fund (TDF) is not very aggressive. The Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 fund, for example, has 55% stocks and 45% bonds.

An alternative is to create a simple portfolio of 70% Total US Stock Market Index fund (VTSAX) and 30% Total International Stock Market Index fund (VGTSX). The expense ratio of the Total US Stock Market Index fund is 0.04%, and the expense ratio of the Total International Stock Market Index fund is 0.07%. These expense ratios are lower than the expense ratio of the TDF.

You could also consider an S&P 500 index fund. For example, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has an expense ratio of 0.","Early Retiree looking at target date index fund

Thoughts?

Target date funds are fine, especially if you're just starting to think about how to invest.

I like the TDFs because they're simple, they're diversified, and they're easy to understand.

The only thing I would say is that the glide path is a little too conservative for me, so I wouldn't put all my money into the 2030 TDF. I'd put something like 80% in, and the rest in a more aggressive fund.

I like the Fidelity Money Market, but you can also put your money into a Fidelity short-term bond index fund.

If you're looking to buy an annuity, the income annuity is a great option for guaranteed monthly income.

Income annuities are not tax-advantaged, so you'll need to pay taxes on the premium, but they're an effective way to convert some of your retirement savings into guaranteed income that you can't outlive.

The income annuity is also a good option if you're looking for a way to balance out your portfolio and lower the risk in your portfolio.

I'm 62 and just started taking SS this year, so I'm not concerned about outliving my money. I'm still working part-time and have a pension that covers my expenses.

I'm looking to diversify my portfolio and lower the risk, so I'm thinking about the income annuity to help balance out my portfolio.

I'm also using an Fidelity Roth IRA to save for my grandchildren. I'm using the Fidelity Contrafund because it has a low expense ratio, and I'm planning to keep it in the Roth for 20 years or so.

I'm also using a Fidelity money market fund to cover any short-term needs and keep my cash safe.

"$BULL (Webull) dropped from $19 to $12 — Is this support level or just a pause before more downside?
Hello traders and investors,

I’ve been following $BULL for a while. A week ago, it looked like it had strong upside potential — especially after it ran up to around $19. But since then, it’s been a steady decline, and now it’s hovering just above $12, which seems to be a key support level based on previous price action. (That's just my opinion)

I haven’t seen much recent discussion about it here, so I’m curious:

Is anyone still bullish on $BULL at these levels?

Do you see any catalysts that could reverse this downtrend?

Or is this support likely to break?

Will be great to see informed opinions and maybe some technical or fundamental takes I haven't considered.

There is not much financial info about Webull, or I just can't find it..

Appreciate your insights!","Well I'd start with the fact that Webull reports earnings next Thursday afternoon for the first time as a public company. That's probably gonna move the stock, and is something you should know if you're long or short. 

Also, there's not much financial info about Webull because they've been public for a month. But their S-1 filing has all their financials from last year, and their 10-Q report next week will have their financials from last quarter. So the information absolutely is out there.","$BULL (Webull) dropped from $19 to $12 — Is this support level or just a pause before more downside?

I’ve been following $BULL for a while. A week ago, it looked like it had strong upside potential — especially after it ran up to around $19. But since then, it’s been a steady decline, and now it’s hovering just above $12, which seems to be a key support level based on previous price action. (That's just my opinion)

I haven’t seen much recent discussion about it here, so I’m curious:

Is anyone still bullish on $BULL at these levels?

Do you see any catalysts that could reverse this downtrend?

Or is this support likely to break?

Will be great to see informed opinions and maybe some technical or fundamental takes I haven't considered.

There is not much financial info about Webull, or I just can't find it..

Appreciate your insights!

### EDIT:  
I'm not sure how long this post will be up, I'm just sharing my observations, I'm not trying to make any calls, but it seems like this stock is in a long-term downtrend, or at least it has been in the last year, and there's no sign of a reversal, it seems like it will continue to fall.

I'm not saying it will fall to zero, but I think it's likely to continue falling.

### EDIT 2:  
I don't know if I'm the only one who's noticed this, but this stock seems to be pumped up by people who don't know what they're talking about.

I'm not saying anything bad about them, but they don't know what they're talking about.

I've seen people talk about how this stock is going to go back to $20, and I don't think that's going to happen.

I'm not saying it's not going to happen, but I don't think it's going to happen.

### EDIT 3:  
I don't think it's going to go back to $20, but I also don't think it's going to go back to $12.

I think it's going to go somewhere in between.

I don't think it's going to go to $16, but I don't think it's going to go to $10.

I think it's going to go somewhere in between.

"Tesla stock soars after DoT unveils new self-driving car rules, set for near-20% weekly rally
[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-soars-after-dot-unveils-new-self-driving-car-rules-set-for-near-20-weekly-rally-183748972.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-soars-after-dot-unveils-new-self-driving-car-rules-set-for-near-20-weekly-rally-183748972.html)

Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) stock surged as much as 10% on Friday, putting shares on track to log a weekly gain north of 17% with several positive catalysts pushing the beleaguered stock higher.

The latest positive headline for the company came late Thursday, when the [Department of Transportation rolled out](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/trumps-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-new-automated-vehicle-framework) a new framework for self-driving car regulation, including ""streamlining"" some reporting requirements for cars equipped with automated or driver-assist systems.

""This Administration understands that we’re in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn’t be higher,"" said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.

""As part of DOT's innovation agenda, our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard that spurs innovation and prioritizes safety,"" Duffy added.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also said in Thursday's statement it would expand an existing program exempting some foreign-made autonomous vehicles from some review processes to accelerate testing to include US-made vehicles.

CEO Elon Musk said on the company's earnings call this week that Tesla expects to be ""selling fully autonomous rides in June in Austin, as we've been saying for now several months. So that's continued.""

Musk added, ""The future of the company is fundamentally based on large-scale autonomous cars and large-scale ... numbers of autonomous humanoid robots. So the value of the company that makes truly useful autonomous humanoid robots and autonomous useful vehicles at scale at low cost, which is what Tesla is going to do is staggering.""

Tesla stock was also getting a boost from a [Bloomberg report that indicated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/tesla-tsla-refunds-early-india-bookings-signaling-entry-is-near?srnd=phx-ai) the company could be close to entering the Indian market after some customers received a notice that their reservation deposit would be refunded.

On its earnings call earlier this week, Tesla said it's been ""very careful trying to figure out when is the right time"" to enter the India market, given the current tariff structure would make Tesla's cars about twice as expensive to sell.

Friday's moves built on an already high-flying week for stock. Shares got their biggest [boost earlier this week](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-rises-after-musk-says-time-at-doge-will-drop-significantly-124551548.html) after Musk said during the company's quarterly earnings call that he would be cutting back his time spent in the Trump administration ""significantly.""

Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, most notably his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has weighed on the perception of the brand among some consumers, [notably in Europe](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-eu-sales-plunge-musk-051010591.html), as the company's sales have flagged to start the year.

Noted Tesla bull Dan Ives said in a client note following Musk's announcement the move was ""an off ramp for Musk out of the Trump White House in our view as the global brand damage, political firestorm, and perfect storm chaos over the past few months will now end this volatile political chapter for Musk and we expect minimal, if any time focused on DOGE going forward.""

""We saw a dialed in Musk on the conference call we have rarely seen in the past,"" Ives added.

Tesla stock fell 50% from its record highs reached in December to its lows of the year. Even including this week's rally, the stock remains down about 30% in 2025.

But this week's flurry of news has pushed the stock back to its highest level in a month.

""The brand damage caused by Musk in the White House/DOGE over the past few months will not go away just by this move and some of the damage will be stained forever in Europe and the US (\~10% future demand destruction we estimate),"" Ives wrote.

""\[But\] this was the time to close one dark chapter and open a brighter one for the Tesla story with autonomous and robotics front and center.""",Slashing red tape for self driving cars.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also said in Thursday's statement it would expand an existing program exempting some foreign-made autonomous vehicles from some review processes to accelerate testing to include US-made vehicles.

CEO Elon Musk said on the company's earnings call last month that Tesla plans to begin offering its new self-driving features to customers in the second half of the year.

""We will have a full self-driving computer on every car that we make, starting this summer. So, it’s going to be a software-over-the-air update,"" Musk said.

""It will be enabled by default. You’ll be able to turn it off, but it’s going to be enabled by default. So, there’s a lot of safety benefits there,"" Musk added.

Musk also said at the time that the company plans to offer a subscription service for its advanced driver-assist features, with the first iteration of the service available in the third quarter of this year.

The company's stock has been on a tear recently, rallying 40% since the start of the year as investors are increasingly bullish on the company's prospects.

Full-AI is a feature that Musk said in 2023 would be available at the end of 2024. Musk said this week that the company would be ""releasing some of the software"" for Full-AI ""in the coming weeks,"" which would be available to some owners of the company's most recent versions of its cars.

Tesla's stock has been under pressure in recent months as the company's robotaxi ambitions have faced delays. Musk said earlier this month that Tesla would be ""ready to ramp"" its Robotaxi service ""probably next year,"" though he added that Tesla would be starting with ""a relatively small number.""

Tesla's stock had plunged on Thursday after the company reported its worst quarterly loss since 2019 and its first decline in annual sales since 2019.

The company reported a net loss of $833 million, or 11 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, down from net income of $1.17 billion, or 16 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

Revenue fell to $22.26 billion, down 9% from $24.72 billion a year earlier.

Tesla's full-year 2024 sales declined 6% to 503,860 vehicles, down from 533,696 vehicles sold in 2023.

The company said in its earnings release Thursday that it delivered 49,662 Model Ys in China, 11,200 Model Y"

Answer: The portfolio is pretty good. I would recommend that you add a few more international stocks to the portfolio, but other than that, I think it's pretty solid. I would recommend that you read the book ""The Bogleheads Guide to Investing"" if you haven't already.

Comment: I have read it. I’m still learning though. I’m trying to get to a point where I can start making my own investment decisions and not just blindly follow the advice of others.

Comment: @KyleNelson I've been a Boglehead for years.  I highly recommend it.  It's the best investment education I've ever had.  If you have any questions about your portfolio, feel free to post here and I'll see if I can answer them.  It's not a bad portfolio, but there are a couple of things I'd change if I were you.  The biggest one is that you're overweight in the small-cap value fund.  I'd recommend that you use the S&P 500 fund instead of the small-cap value fund.  You should also probably change the international fund from VXUS to VEA, VWO, or VXUS.  I'll post more thoughts in the comments.

Comment: @KyleNelson Also, I'd recommend that you change the dividend fund from the one that you have to either VYM or SDY.  I'd also recommend that you use VOO instead of VTI.","Feedback on my portfolio

I would say that the only thing you are really missing is the ability to get into some individual stocks.
I would suggest looking into a ""deep value"" strategy that focuses on individual companies. You can get into a lot of companies this way, and it's a very inexpensive way to do it.
The one I'm most familiar with is the ""Greenblatt"" approach. You can find a lot of information on this approach by searching for ""Greenblatt"" on google.
There are also a number of other approaches, but this is one that has been around for a while and has worked for a lot of people.
Another thing I would suggest is that you look into some of the more ""fundamental"" investing approaches. This is a whole other topic, but I would say that most ""value investors"" would say that the more ""fundamental"" the better.

"Chase only applied $23 of my $23,000 credit card payment.. now they’re reversing it and I’m stuck. Please help.
Hi everyone, I really need some advice or insight. About a month ago, I made a large payment of $23,000 to my Chase Freedom Unlimited card to pay off my balance. But when the payment posted, Chase only credited me $23.00.

I immediately reached out through their secure message center for a written record. Since then, it’s been a back and forth for almost two months. Chase asked me to provide:

	•	A full bank statement showing the withdrawal
	•	A fax of my payment confirmation and transmittal report
	•	An official letterhead statement from my bank confirming the payment

I provided everything they asked for, including confirmation that the funds were withdrawn by Chase on March 17, 2025. Today, they messaged me saying they couldn’t verify the payment and reversed the temporary credit they had applied during the investigation.

I’ve contacted my bank (Wells Fargo), and they’ve confirmed multiple times that the full $23,000 was sent to Chase. They even offered to speak to Chase directly and gave me a letter on official letterhead to back it up.

I’ve now filed a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), but I’m scared. My money is in limbo, I feel like I’m getting the runaround, and no one is taking accountability.

Could this be a rare glitch or tech issue? Did my bank mess up? Is Chase ignoring the evidence? I don’t know what else to do, and this is incredibly stressful. If anyone has experience with something similar or has advice, I’d be grateful.","Don’t just trust wells fargo

Chase bank credit card customer

Comment: Why do you think Chase Bank would lie?

Comment: @JoeBlow I think Chase is a big company with a lot of money. I’m not saying they’re lying, but I’m concerned that they’re not being honest.

Comment: They're not being dishonest. They're being extremely incompetent.

Comment: @JoeBlow that’s what I’m afraid of. I’ve never had a banking issue this big, and I’m very scared.

Comment: @JoeBlow I’ve contacted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and they’re investigating. I’m hoping they can help.

Comment: If you have not already done so, you should file a dispute with your credit card company, since you are not in agreement with the bank. This would be the fastest way to resolve this, and the CFPB can help you with that.

Answer: I would not think that Chase is lying, but I would think that they are not being forthright.

It sounds like the payment was not received by Chase.

If you do not trust Chase, then you should probably not trust Wells Fargo either.

I would be very careful with how I interpret the evidence that you have received.

I would consider the possibility that the funds were not received by Chase because the bank that you bank with was unable to make the transfer.

I would also consider the possibility that the funds were not received by Chase because Chase was unable to receive the funds.

I would also consider the possibility that the funds were not received by Chase because the funds were sent to a bank account that Chase does not use.

I would also consider the possibility that the funds were not received by Chase because the funds were sent to a bank account that Chase does not use, but Chase did not realize that the funds were not received because Chase does not use that bank account.

I would also consider the possibility that the funds were not received by Chase because Chase never received the payment.

I would also consider the possibility that the funds were not received by Chase because Chase received the payment, but the payment was not correctly recorded.

Please help me, Reddit. What do I do?

Edit: thank you everyone for the support and advice. I spoke with a manager at Chase again today and they’re escalating the case. Fingers crossed!

Edit 2: after 2 more weeks of back and forth, I finally got a supervisor to help. They reopened the case and are investigating further. I’m not holding my breath but at least it’s moving.

## Question:
I would recommend getting a lawyer to assist you. 

Chase has been known to hold on to money for months and months. I’ve heard of people getting their money back after a lawyer got involved."

**Google is the cheapest of the Mag 7.**

Google (GOOG) is the cheapest of the Mag 7 stocks, trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.37—significantly below Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), which trade at 37.31, 28.22, and 30.09, respectively.

**Google’s cloud business is growing rapidly.**

Google Cloud’s revenue has grown by 15% year-over-year in Q1 2025, with strong momentum in AI, data analytics, and hybrid cloud services. The company expects cloud revenue to grow by 17% to 20% annually, with significant upside potential.

**Google’s margins are impressive.**

Google’s operating margins are consistently above 26%, far higher than Nvidia and Meta, which are struggling with declining ad revenues. This gives Google significant pricing power and financial resilience.

**Google’s AI strategy is gaining momentum.**

Google has invested heavily in AI infrastructure, hiring over 3,000 AI researchers, and is increasing its AI-based offerings across search, YouTube, and cloud. The company expects AI revenue to grow by 30% to 40% annually.

**Google’s dividend yield is attractive.**

Google offers a dividend yield of 1.79%, significantly higher than Meta and Apple. This provides income stability and makes Google attractive for investors seeking dividends.

**Google’s Q1 2025 results were strong.**

Google reported strong Q1 2025 results, with revenue growing 16% year-over-year to $49.9 billion, with 24% growth in cloud revenue, and a 21% jump in AI revenue"
"FRS Investment Plan Strategy

I have been a little worried about the active efforts by Desantis and others in the pension management in the effort to root out ""wokeness"" and ESG within the investment funds and  I guess I just trust Vanguard more than the FRS administrators so I recently opened  a self directed brokerage account and put all in a Vanguard TDF (but for the 5K that has to remain in FRS investment funds).

This is what I was told to expect from the plan.
I was also told that they are going to be doing a major restructuring of the plan this year. I was hoping to start investing in the next couple months.
So I can only assume the FRS Investment Plan is what I'm looking for?
Anyway, here is a link to the investment funds they offer.
I'm assuming the first fund is a bond fund?

I'm assuming that if I go with that, it's going to be more volatile?
I was thinking about the S&P 500 fund but I'm not sure. I'm assuming that if I go with that, it's going to be more volatile?
The S&P 500 fund is the largest, most diversified US stock fund. It is not a mutual fund, it is a managed account with a portfolio that is designed to mirror the S&P 500 index. The portfolio is rebalanced quarterly.
You can invest in one of these:
Mutual Funds (a type of stock fund that is traded on the open market and has a portfolio of stocks)
Investment Funds (a type of stock fund that is not traded on the open market and has a portfolio of stocks)
Bond Funds (a type of stock fund that invests in bonds)
The first fund you listed is a mutual fund. It is a US stock fund that invests in large cap stocks.
The second fund is an investment fund. It is a US stock fund that invests in large cap stocks.
The third fund is a bond fund. It is a US bond fund that invests in US Treasury bonds and other US government bonds.
Investment funds are not traded on the open market, so you can't buy or sell them like you can with mutual funds. You can only buy or sell shares of the fund when you contribute to your account.

Re: FRS Investment Plan Strategy
If you are looking for stable, I would go with a few of the FRS Stable Value Funds. FRS 1550 is an S&P 500 index fund, and FRS 3520 is a Total Bond Market Index Fund. Both are low fee, stable funds that will grow slowly and steadily over time.
I would also look at the FRS Small Cap Funds, such as FRS 1150, 1160, and 1170. These are also low fee, S&P 600 index funds.
I would also look at the FRS Mid Cap Funds, such as FRS 1120, 1130, and 1140. These are also low fee, S&P 400 index funds.
Finally, I would look at the FRS Large Cap Funds, such as FRS 1110, 1180, and 1190. These are also low fee, S&P 500 index funds.
There is no single best fund for your portfolio. You need to select a mix of funds that are low fee, have low expense ratios, and are in line with your investment objectives.
I would recommend that you read the wiki article on the FRS investment plan: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/FRS:_Investment_Plan
The Bogleheads wiki has a lot of information about the FRS investment plan.
You can also check out the FRS Investment Plan FAQ: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/FRS:_Investment_Plan_FAQ
I would also recommend that you read the book ""FRS: The Simple Path to Retirement"" by Brent Lilly, which is available for free online.

You're already over 750. You're likely just missing out on a point or two.
There are a few things you can do to get that last point or two.
Pay off all of your credit cards. You can also call up the credit card companies and ask for a credit limit increase. Most credit cards will do this if you have a history of on-time payments.
You can also try and get a few more accounts. I'm not sure how many you have, but a few more accounts can help boost your score a bit.
Finally, you can check your credit report to make sure there aren't any errors. Sometimes mistakes can lower your score.

This was the moment that made me realize what a truly amazing season this was.
When you’re on the road, you’re always in a race. You’re always trying to get to the finish line first. You’re always trying to win. But there’s also this moment where you’re not trying to win anymore. You’re just trying to finish.
When the final bell rings, you’re no longer trying to win. You’re just trying to finish. You’re not trying to win anymore. You’re not trying to finish anymore. You’re just trying to survive.
This is when you realize that you’re not a hero anymore. You’re just a survivor.
This is the moment that the season truly begins to come together. This is the moment where the story begins to take shape. This is the moment where the stakes are raised. This is the moment where the fate of the world is decided.
This is the moment where the season truly becomes epic.
This is the moment where the heroes are no longer wearing rings. They’re wearing scars.
This is the moment where the season becomes a classic.
This is the moment where the story is no longer about winning. It’s about surviving.
This is the moment where the season truly becomes legendary.

"Signs of consolidation trap in SPY
Hi all, just got myself out of a consolidation trap. SPY looked like it was trending down, bought a 541 0dte put thinking it would be of one of its midday reversals (had rejected R1, 1 min MACD confirmed downwrd trend and 5 min MACD curling down but hadnt crossed and both RSIs were trending down after being overbought). I've tightened my risk management and got out at -8% loss knowing full well this would just theta burn my option (lost most after freezing when mango had his stunt a couple weeks ago so building back slowly and hopefully more intellegently).

So question is: what are some of the signs you look for to avoid such a trap? I had asked a similar question a while back and used that great advice to focus on support and resistance areas and now just trying to better finesse my strategy.

Comment: You need to focus on *risk management* not strategy.

Comment: I have no idea what you mean by risk management, if you mean how to avoid being caught in such a trap, then I thought risk management is what I've been trying to do, but I've just been burned on this.

Comment: When I said ""risk management"" I meant the opposite of what I just said. I'm not sure what you mean by *risk management* but it sounds like you're focusing on *strategy* to avoid being caught in such a trap.

Comment: I guess you're right, I just thought of risk management as a way to avoid getting caught in a trap. Sorry for the confusion, I just got caught up in the trade and wasn't thinking straight.

Comment: It's ok. I'm happy to help. I'll make a post about risk management.

Comment: Just a note, if you're doing options, it's best to have a brokerage account with at least $25k in it. Most brokerages will allow you to do options trading with less but you'll be limited to options on ETFs.

Comment: Ok, thanks. Yeah, I'm starting to look for a brokerage that will allow me to start trading options. I'm trying to get more intellegent about how to trade options so I'll be very interested to read your post on risk management.

Comment: I made a post about risk management.

Answer: First, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to discourage you from trading options. I'm just trying to help you avoid getting caught in a trap like the one you've described.

\section{What is risk management?}

Risk management is the practice of managing the risks associated with trading options. It's a set of rules that you follow when trading options.

\section{How to manage risk}

The goal of risk management is to limit your downside and increase your upside. This is done by setting stop losses and using [greeks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_%28finance%29) to manage your risk.

I have been a bear on SPY for a long time but have been burned by options expiring worthless. I was thinking of doing a long strangle to maximize my profit and minimize my loss. I have been looking for a breakout from the long term down trend and a chance to get a good entry. 

I am thinking of buying 500 puts and 500 calls expiring in 3 months. I would like to get a 10% profit on my investment. I am thinking of buying at a strike price of 550 and 500. I would like to get the chance to get a 20% profit but I know I will not get there. 

If SPY is above 550 I would sell the calls and if SPY is below 500 I would sell the puts. If SPY is between 500 and 550 I would just hold on to the options. If SPY goes above 550 I would sell the calls and if SPY is below 500 I would sell the puts. If SPY is between 500 and 550 I would just hold on to the options.

I know this is a long post but I am looking for advice on this. Thanks.

"Buying My First House at 48
I'm at a point in my life where I’m unsure what to do about what will likely be the biggest purchase I ever make: buying a home.

I’ve been steadily saving and investing, and I now have over $350,000 available across cash, ETFs, savings, and crypto. I’ve been planning to purchase a property—as a first-time homebuyer—but I live in New Jersey, where the real estate market is still highly competitive. You often have to fight for a good listing.

Based on my income, I can comfortably afford a home in the $800K–$1M range. Realistically, in my area, anything significantly below that isn’t even worth looking at—unless I go for something in the $550K–$650K range and commit to a full renovation and expansion.

But on the other hand… is it really worth buying a house at this point in my life?

I currently rent a comfortable house for just $2,000 a month total. I’ve been there for 10 years. It’s owned by a friend, so rent increases have been minimal. The town isn’t ideal, but my only child goes to private school, and we have another three years before we’ll need to make a decision about high school.

So here’s the dilemma:  
Would it make more sense to **keep renting** and **continue investing** the money I would otherwise be spending on a mortgage, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance?  
Or should I **buy a house**, build equity, and invest significantly less going forward?","New Jersey has the highest property tax in the nation at 2.3%.  At the proposed price point you would be paying 1,300-1,700 a month in property taxes alone.  On top of the it would be $250 or so a month for insurance.  At the top end you would be paying more in property tax and insurance alone than you are right now for your whole house.  You would be going from 2,000/month to 7,000/month, not even counting maintenance. Thats not a great investment strategy.

You have a sweet deal right now.  Hold on to it as long as you can, and be extra extra nice to your friend. Meanwhile put the extra 5,000 you are not spending on mortgage, insurance and taxes into investments.","Buying My First House at 48

If I’m going to buy, I’ll likely buy a home in the $600K–$700K range. It’ll be a lot to put down and will have a hefty monthly mortgage payment. But I’ll have a home I can live in comfortably for the rest of my life, and my child will be able to live in it after I die.

I’ve done a lot of research and have read a lot of opinions on the subject. Here are my questions:  

1. Do you think it’s better to keep renting or to buy?  
2. If you were to buy, would you buy a home that was already in great condition, or would you buy a home that needed a lot of work and then renovate it?  
3. How much equity should you be looking to build in a home?  
4. How do you feel about the idea of buying a home that's a 20-minute drive from work?

I’m not going to buy a home just to buy a home. I want to do this right. I’m looking for advice and opinions from experienced investors.

Thank you in advance!

\begin{itemize}
\item \strong{Do you think it’s better to keep renting or to buy?}
\end{itemize}

\strong{Keep renting}

Investing is the better route.  This is not a good time to buy a home.  There are a lot of people out there who have the same mentality as you.  As a result, the prices are sky high, and there is a lot of competition.  I don't know if this is a short term or long term thing, but I'd wait it out.

\strong{Buy a home that needs a lot of work and then renovate it}

If you're going to buy, I would buy a home that needs a lot of work and then renovate it.  You'll have a lot of equity in the home, and you'll have a nice place to live in.

\strong{How much equity should you be looking to build in a home?}

The amount of equity you should be looking to build is the amount of money that you can afford to lose.","Buying My First House at 48

"Tom Hougaard – copy trading experiment
I’ve been in the Trader Tom’s group for quite some time now, but I never closely followed his strategies or live streams because I trade completely different markets and at the same time when he trades. Though I was fascinated about his 10k challenge as it’s something that many ordinary people could relate to. Also, I found that some people here[ were asking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/14a6pmu/tom_hougaard_anyone_following_his_trades_exactly/) about whether it’s possible to follow him and make money. Recently, I got some time and decided to test whether it’s possible to make the same returns as Tom. So, for the last two weeks I decided to copy trade him as close as physically possible and see what returns I would be able to get. I know that copy trading is bad and very rarely works, but I wanted to find the specific reasons why it would or wouldn’t not work with him. Below are the results.

But before we start, I’d like to note that this post is not about Tom. I actually think he is a good trader. He puts a lot of educational content for free and helps people to fight alcohol addiction. And at the same time, he has to deal with a lot of crazy followers who demand something from him. People get things for free and demand returns. Mental.

The goal of this post is to answer the following question: **can you get the same returns as him by copy following him during his live streams?** I think the results might be interesting for anyone who is thinking about doing the same.

TLDR & Spoiler Alert: >!no you can’t.!<

The rules of engagement:

\-	10k £ account with TD365

\-	Take every trade he takes during the 2 live streams every day

\-	Take the other trades if there is possibility (eg I have access to my account)

\-	It’s not about making profit; it’s about having similar (or at least proportional) wins and losses

Testing period: 28 Apr 2025 – 11 May 2025

Below is the list of issues that I encountered during these 2 weeks:

1. Account size

At the start of the testing period his account was already 30k. And if you start with only 10k – it means that your account size is 3x smaller than his account. And that’s a problem, because it gives him 3x more buying power. I didn’t think it was a problem first. I was ready to have 3x bigger drawdowns than him in % value of the account. From his telegram the biggest drawdown he had until this moment was around 5%, so I was totally ok with a 15% drawdown of the 10k account. However, the problem happened to be the actual buying power. When a trade goes his way – he goes really big. And you just run out of money to open as many trades as him very quickly. So, you simply can’t open the same trades.

*== Upd#1: a number of users raised a valid question in the comments, asking why I had the same position sizes as him if his account was 3x times bigger than mine. Well, the position sizes I took was according to the Tom's recommendations for the 10k account (you can see the screenshot in the comments below). And it just happened that 80% of all positions were in these limits and 100% positions were under 2% risk.*

2)	Margin

This is a continuation of the previous problem, but on a much bigger scale. Trader Tom has 0.5% margin requirements. I live in the UK. UK's Financial Conduct Authority requirement for major indices is 5%. The same for the European Union (ESMA Regulations), Australia or Canada. Which means that if you live in any of these countries then you have 10 times (!) smaller buying power than Tom even if your account is exactly the same as his.

~~Tbh, that surprised me a bit because as far as I know Tom resides in Copenhagen, Denmark (at least that’s what his Twitter account says) and his company (Thomas Hougaard Invest ApS) is also registered in Denmark. Denmark is a member of EU which means it should be regulated under ESMA and he should also have 5% requirements. But somehow, he has 0.5% margin. That means that he has another company registered somewhere outside of the mentioned above countries. I couldn’t find any information about his other company, but this is not so important. What is important that your margin requirements will allow you to buy only 10 less than what he is able to buy. And taking into account the previous point about your initial account size smaller than his, we can say that his actual buying power is 3 x 10 = 30 (!!!) time bigger than yours.~~

*== Upd#2: thanks to the comments below this mystery has been resolved. So here is what happens here: According to the* [*TD365 Privacy Policy*](https://td365.com/en-gb/privacy-policy-2/) *they are registered in 4 countries: UK, SA, Australia and Bahamas. In all other countries they operate unlicensed. That means that if you're located in the EU (eg Denmark) for example, you can open an account with them and have 200x leverage even though ESMA allows only 20x max. That gives you bigger buying power (the same as Tom has) but leaves you unprotected if anything goes wrong. I don't mean a case when TD365 decides to do something dodgy (as they look like a legitimate broker), but if they legitimate go bankrupt, all your money will be gone. Moreover, Danish Financial Authority issued an* [*explicit warning* ](https://www.dfsa.dk/supervision/warnings-against-companies/2025/warning-against-investing-with-td365com)*saying that you are on your own if you trade with TD365. That leaves you with 2 options: either you take an extra risk and go with TD365 in order to have the same prices and leverage as Tom, or go with a licensed in your country broker and get into the same situation as I where your buying power is 10x smaller than his. If this is your case - keep reading, if you have 200x leverage you can skip this point.*

Now, why does it matter? Let’s take a look at specific numbers, shall we?

The current value of the us US Tech 100 is 20,043, but let’s make it 20,000 for the ease of calculation. To buy a single contract you have to put 5% of margin.

20,000 x 0.05 = 1000£

Tom’s default position for this index is 2 contracts. So, you need to put 2k£ as a deposit for a default entry on a single index. He also trades Wall Street 30 at the same time. The cost of it is 40k and he trades a single contract in the beginning. That means another 2k£. In total you’d need to put 4k£ deposits to open just default positions that Tom takes.

Tom has a very good position sizing and risk management attitude. He trades a classical trade following philosophy: you never add to your losers, and you keep adding to your winners as long as they go your way. I think it’s a right attitude because in this way you keep your losers small and you have big winners. As a result, normally Tom loses a bit here, a bit there, and then he gets a big winner that covers all his losers and brings much more. I really like this strategy and think it’s the right approach to trading. So, if it’s the right approach to trading then what’s the problem?

Well, you see, as we identified above you, if you open a default position in US 100 and Wall Street 30 you already need to put 4k from your account. If you open the second positions – that’s already 8k £ out of your 10K account are locked. However, at the same time for Tom, because he has only 0.5% requirements instead of your 5%, it will be only 800£ out of his 30k account. So he can add 40 times more contracts to his winning positions while you can’t because you don’t have any buying power left.

That lead to a situation where your losers will be the same as his: he opens a position, you do the same, then the position loses and you both lose the same amount. But with the winners, because he can add much more contracts while you’re already out of your buying power, he will get much bigger winners which will cover his losses, but your winners might not even cover yours.

And that’s exactly what happen on Friday, 9th of May. My account was already minus 2k by this time and below 8k. Which means that I could have opened only 7 contracts. While Tom didn’t have this limitation for his winning position. As a result, I ended the session with an additional loss of 231£ while he ended the session with 170£ in profit. That happened because we had initial losses of the same size, but his wins were bigger than mine simply because I couldn’t open as many contracts as he did.

3)	Margin calls

When you max out your account (and you will very quickly, trust me) you start getting so called margin calls from your broker. That happens when you put all available money into the margin and if the position goes against you, you start using more money than you have. As a result, the broker sends you a message that you should add more money or your position will be forcibly liquidated. Which might lead to a situation where Tom will still have his position open because the stop loss is not reached and later it will turn into his favour and profit, but your position will be closed by the broker in minus and there is not much you can do about it.

With the 10k account size I was getting margin calls twice a day from the broker.

4)	Managing positions outside of the live streaming.

The initial plan was to trade with Tom only during his live streams. However, very quickly I found out that he doesn’t always close his positions at the end of the stream. Which is kind of makes sense, because if the price goes your way you just let it go as much as you can. And then later on his telegram channel he announces that he moves a stop loss or closes the position. For us, followers, it means that it’s not just 2 hours of trading with him per day. You have to wait for a notification to come at any time and be ready to close the position the same minute he messages it. Because he closes it when he sees a double top, a resistance or anything else that might reverse the price direction. And if you don’t close it at the same minute, you’re running into a pretty good chance, that something that ended up as a win for him, will be a loser for you. Even if you close just 5 minutes later. That happened to me a couple of times.

Which means, that it’s not just 2 hours of live streaming. It’s a full time, 12-hour job on standby at least from 8am to 8pm. Doesn’t matter if you have a meeting with a customer, on a date, or in a toilet – you have to react to the messages in his chat immediately.

5)	New positions outside of live streaming

This part is the most mysterious to me, to be honest. His official reasons for the 10k challenge are a complete transparency and education. And he does it pretty well during the live streams. He explains what he does, why he does it and tells you the exact minute he opens a position. However, for whatever reason, he decides to also open new positions completely outside of the streams. Sometimes he announces them in the chat, sometimes he doesn’t. On Thursday he opened 32 (!) contracts and just showed a screenshot with 1249 points in profit. Then he said that his system froze, and he couldn’t get all the profit and ended up only with 2k profit. To be completely fair, later he said as he bought them without telling anyone he is going to withdraw it from the account. But why did he buy them in the first place? I understand why he bought them in his big account, because that’s where he makes money, but he needed to open the second account click the Buy button 16 times, then sell it, while he was trying to do the same on the big account. That’s a lot of extra work for no visible reason.

He is another example. That’s a screenshot he posted in the chat the other day:

https://preview.redd.it/2gngydbjtxze1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=1717c5844720a301add19e8fe4f44349fc2b5970

The two trades at the top were taken during a live stream. But the third trade… he never mentioned it. It’s not a big profit either. He just silently took it. Why? Who was it done for? For the followers? Unlikely. We would have never known about this trade if he didn’t include it in the screen shot 12h later. For his profit? Also unlikely, that’s the educational account and it’s only 100£.

And he does it quite regularly. He said he taking trades while everyone watched Al Brooks live stream on 1st of May, but he never said which trades he took. And there is no way for you to repeat the profit of these trades because you just don’t know about them. Does he do it to show that people with trading knowledge and experience can make money outside of the market open hour? Well, some people can make 100% per month on small account, that’s not a secret knowledge. But people who watch him can’t. That’s why they watch him in the first place. If they could – they would do it by themselves instead of watching him.

So, yeah, I just don’t know why he does it. But he does it, hence the account profit doesn’t correspond to profits that are visible during the live streams.

6)	Drawdowns

Tom had a rough patch these two weeks and a series of losses. I totally can accept that I was just a bit unlucky and I joined his streams in the period of drawdowns. But again, the point was not to make money during these two weeks (though I’d love to) but to understand if it’s possible to get similar returns.

His maximum account size was 34,967£, the lowest reported number was 30,256£. That gives us a drawdown of 4,711£. This is a 13.5% drawdown from the top. It’s unpleasant but not too bad taking into account that he theoretically made over 300% in the previous 4 month.

However, 4,711£ is 13.5% from his account. If you were unlucky to join at this period with the 10k account – that’s a whopping 47% drawdown. Ask yourself: can you stomach losing half of your money in 2 weeks? And what is more important, even if you’re hard-boiled trader and 47% is acceptable to you, is it acceptable to your margin? As we discussed above, you already have much 10x smaller buying power than him even you had the same account size. But now, your buying power halved. So, he can still open 85% of the positions that he could 2 weeks ago, but you can open only 50% of the same positions. Which means that from this point your wins will be two times smaller than his but your losses still will be mostly the same (because you still can open the initial 1-2 contract positions.

7)	Actual numbers

During these 2 weeks I wrote down all number that were visible during the live streams and in his telegram. The table below presents the reported PnL, calculated account size based on the reported PnL and the reported account size. He doesn’t show the account size every day, that’s why it appears only on some dates.

Total	-3539

The PnL numbers are just the numbers that were visible, but trades that he never said about or trades that he closed in minus outside of the streams without telling the exact loss, are not in the list, because there is no way to find out about them. That might explain why the calculated account amount and the reported account amount are different.

**Conclusion:**

Do I think Trader Tom is a legit trader, and he makes good profits every month?

\-	Yes, I do. From everything I’ve seen I think he is a good trader and a decent human being.

Would it be possible for you to make the same money if you try to copy trade his every trade during live streaming:

\-	No, it will not. Because:

o	Your account will be smaller, unless you put exactly the same money as he has at moment of you joining him, and not 10k

o	Even if you put the same money in but use a licensed broker you still will have a 10x smaller buying power because his margin is 0.5% and yours is 5% unless you use an broker without a license (TD365 is not licensed in Europe or Canada)

o	It’s not just 2 hours of live streaming, you need to be on alert for at least 12 hours every working day and ready to act

o	And even if you have the same account size, the same broker, the same leverage and has ability to access your account for 12 hours, you still will not have the same returns because of the trades he takes outside without any notification.

So, if you’re thinking about coping him **DON’T DO IT** – it will not make you money. Well, ideally you should not copy trade anyone. You can watch his streams if you decide to study his trading style, but that’s as much you should expect from them.","Thanks for the write up!

I have been in Tom's group for a couple of years now and sharing my perspective.

I think as per the other comment sizing down would make sense. End of the day you should be comparing if you could take as many wins / losses and points attached to those as Tom and not the amount of money those wins / losses bring. Because the money aspect is subjective for each trader based on their risk tolerance, leverage available etc. Also the leverage available to Tom is likely because he is eligible to have a professional trader account - which allows for the 0.5 margin as opposed to 5. 

The point of Tom making trades and not sharing them - I believe Tom does not include in his public record the trades he did not share, also he withdraws the money associated with such trades. 

He is only human though so likely misses some trades he took privately, so it would be difficult to keep up 100%.

I would have expected results to not match Tom's due to things like:

- Delay in copy trade - price moves too fast before you can copy him
- Missing key trades where he's made up for huge losses - he is a very volatile trader at times 
- not being comfortable / mentally ready to take on the risks Tom does
- and more along these themes","Tom Hougaard – copy trading experiment
I’ve been in the Trader Tom’s group for quite some time now, but I never closely followed his strategies or live streams because I trade completely different markets and at the same time when he trades. Though I was fascinated about his 10k challenge as it’s something that many ordinary people could relate to. Also, I found that some people here[ were asking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/14a6pmu/tom_hougaard_anyone_following_his_trades_exactly/) about whether it’s possible to follow him and make money. Recently, I got some time and decided to test whether it’s possible to make the same returns as Tom. So, for the last two weeks I decided to copy trade him as close as physically possible and see what returns I would be able to get. I know that copy trading is bad and very rarely works, but I wanted to find the specific reasons why it would or wouldn’t not work with him. Below are the results.

But before we start, I’d like to note that this post is not about Tom. I actually think he is a good trader. He puts a lot of educational content for free and helps people to fight alcohol addiction. And at the same time, he has to deal with a lot of crazy followers who demand something from him. People get things for free and demand returns. Mental.

The goal of this post is to answer the following question: **can you get the same returns as him by copy following him during his live streams?** I think the results might be interesting for anyone who is thinking about doing the same.

Testing period: 28 Apr 2025 – 12 May 2025

The result:

I’ve lost 945 £. I lost 95% of the trades I copied. That’s almost as bad as him, who lost 93%. However, the main difference is that I didn’t make any big wins. In fact, I didn’t have any wins at all. I only had one loss (400 £) and I lost 4 times less than him.

In conclusion, copy trading is a stupid idea. If you want to make money, you need to understand markets and strategies. It’s not about following a person on social media.

**Update 15/05/2025:**

I decided to do another experiment. This time I focused on only his big trades. For example, if he bought 1000 shares, I bought 1000 shares. And if he didn’t buy anything, I didn’t buy anything. The result is pretty much the same.

I’m not sure if this is a fluke or if it’s actually possible to copy him. However, I’m not going to do it anymore. I think that trading is not something that you can learn by copying someone.

Pectra lets hackers drain wallets with just an offchain signature,"This is a load of FUD. Ofc it's from cointelegraph. While I get the point, no one should be signing arbitrary messages to begin with. Most people that would fall for a phishing site asking them to sign something would sign it regardless of whether it was a transaction stealing all their funds or if it was a message that ultimately steals funds.

I find the distinction between ""signing an onchain transaction"" and ""signing an offchain message"" to be disingenuous. Unless I'm missing something, these are just signatures that can both be created offline in the same manner. Yes, people might not realize that signing a message could mean draining their funds, but again, people signing arbitrary shit with their keys for no reason are already fucked.

>This new form of attack can be easily executed through common offchain interactions like phishing emails, fake DApps, or Discord scams.

I'm sorry but how can you not perform the exact same attack via the same interactions but for a TX instead of a message? Can someone please explain to me what I'm missing if I am missing anything?

**TLDR**: Pectra lets attackers drain wallets with just an offchain signature.

**Issue:** The attacker only needs to sign a message on the pectra chain to drain funds. The message is not even sent to the wallet. The wallet will still show the funds as ""spent"". The only way to detect the issue is to view the logs. The attacker can also send multiple messages to drain funds.

"FABXX v. FDLXX v. SGOV for Overtaxed Californian
I’m a California resident and don’t want to pay more taxes. I’m in the highest brackets. I’d like to know what you think of these options for parking cash:

1. FABXX (Fidelity California Municipal MMF). It has a 2.42% yield but should be exempt from both state and federal taxes. The ER is 0.42 percent.

2. FDLXX. It has a higher yield (3.90%) and than FABXX and the same ER, but it’s not exempt from federal tax.

This is what I hold in my brokerage account that acts as a checking account. *I bought FRSXX in a Wells Fargo account and transferred it over to Fidelity to dodge the 10 million minimum investment.*

For the rest of my money, I split it between USFR and CSHI; these pay better than FRSXX/FDLXX, but don't auto-liquidate, so you'd have to sell the position to have the cash. USFR is similar to SGOV, but pick what you prefer.","FABXX v. FDLXX v. SGOV for Overtaxed Californian

3. SGOV. It has a higher yield (4.82%) and much lower ER (.09%) than both FABXX and FDLXX, but it’s not exempt from federal tax.

I’m not sure what to do. I’d appreciate your advice.

Comment: I think you have a typo here. The ER is 0.42%, not 0.92%.

Comment: Oops, that was a typo. Thanks for catching it. I fixed it.

Answer: I'm not an expert on the taxation of municipal bonds, but it seems to me that the 4.82% you get from SGOV is not only higher than the 3.90% you get from FDLXX, but it's also higher than the 2.42% you get from FABXX. So I'd go with SGOV.

Answer: I would pick SGOV for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item The tax-exempt status is the most important.
\item The tax-exempt status is the easiest to verify.
\item The tax-exempt status is the most valuable (as in, it's worth the most money).
\end{itemize}

If you're willing to take the risk that the tax-exempt status may not be what you're expecting, then I'd pick FDLXX.

I don't know anything about FABXX.

Answer: I think the answer is that it depends on what you want to do with the money.

If you just want to leave it there, then FABXX is your best bet. It's exempt from both state and federal taxes, so it's a nice little tax-free savings account.

If you want to put it to work, then SGOV is the best bet. It's exempt from state tax, and while it's not exempt from federal tax, it's not going to be taxed on the interest anyway.

Answer: The yield is a very poor metric for comparing different types of funds.  In this case, the ER is also a poor metric.  Instead, use the distribution yield.

SGOV has a 4.82% distribution yield.  FDLXX has a 3.90% distribution yield.  FABXX has a 2.42% distribution yield.  I can't tell you the distribution yield of FDLXX, but it","FABXX v. FDLXX v. SGOV for Overtaxed Californian

Edit: I’m looking to park cash, not invest for growth. I have a 401k, IRA, and brokerage account. I have enough invested for retirement.

Edit 2: I just realized that I probably shouldn’t be comparing MMFs to SGOV. I’m not sure what to do.

###Municipal bond fund options for a California resident

You are correct in that California municipal bonds are exempt from federal tax.

However, your question is very broad and I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for. Are you looking for a way to hold cash? Are you looking to park cash? Are you looking to invest for growth?

In order to answer your question, we need more information on your financial goals and current portfolio.

I'd recommend looking at the following resources to help you decide on a tax-efficient strategy:

* [California State and Local Taxes](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/california-state-and-local-taxes/) (White Coat Investor)

These articles will help you understand the pros and cons of investing in California municipal bonds.

If you're looking for a cash equivalent, I'd recommend looking at [Fidelity California Municipal Money Market Fund (FABXX)](https://www.fidelity.com/funds/mutual-funds/summary/304942647) with a 2.42% yield and a 0.42% expense ratio.

If you're looking for a higher yield and are willing to pay a higher expense ratio, I'd recommend looking at [Fidelity California Municipal Money Market Fund (FDLXX)](https://www.fidelity.com/funds/mutual-funds/summary/305797422) with a 3.9% yield and a 0.5% expense ratio"

WASHINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the United States was in a ""transition period"" in its economy, but he downplayed fears of a short-term recession as a result of the spreading coronavirus.
""We're in a transition period. It's a very, very strong period,"" Trump said at a White House news conference, adding that the virus ""will go away.""
""We're in a very strong period. We're talking about a very short-term recession, if you're going to use that term, it's going to be short term. It's going to go away,"" he said.
""I'm not concerned at all. I'm not concerned at all. We're going to come out of it. It's going to go away,"" he added.

"Iron Condor Strategy with Conversion to Low Risk High Profit
This Iron Condor strategy involves selling 2 SPX Iron Condors with the price outside and in between the 2 IC's. This creates a zero delta trade. (See images below). The price then trades into one of the IC's.

I have traded this over a few months and it worked well with Mango doing shite.

When the price is outside the IC you benefit from lower risk and higher profit, and you do not immediately lose money from that nasty curve in the middle of an IC. This strategy does well in a some what volatile environment.

**The goal** is to have the price move into one of the IC's and, then either let the IC expire for the profit or **convert** the winning IC by locking in the profit, and then make money going in the opposite direction with low risk and high profit.

**Part I** of the strategy is to sell 2 Iron Condors ( 2 DTE to 7 DTE, they need time for the price to move) approx. 150 wide on the lower IC and approx. 100-130 on the upper IC.

**TIP**: Make sure to sell the 2 IC's at the same time otherwise you can end up locking in a loss if the price moves against you between sells.

You can go really wide on the lower IC without the IC cost being effected.

The upper IC is sensitive to width and max is about 130 wide.

The difference between the strikes is 20.

The distance between the current price and the IC is 35. So 70 wide total.  
So the price needs to move 35 in either direction to enter one of the IC's.

If you go wider on this the IC does not perform well on very slow days, and the price is stuck in the middle of the 2 IC's. You also want the price to be able to easily trade into one of the IC's.

**The Trade Mechanics**

Because this trade is zero delta you cannot lose money on the first day. But you cannot make money either. We can either let an IC expire when the price is in the IC or we can convert the IC to a more profitable strategy.

**Example of the conversion:**

Let's say you open this trade at 3.30 pm. In the morning the price is already deep in the upper IC due to pre market movement.

You will not show any profit on this due to the zero delta. But if you look at the IC that the price traded into, you will see that IC is now at a profit and the lower IC is at a loss.  
The profit and loss are almost the same on both IC's hence no profit.

If the profit is high enough, we now convert the IC's and lock in that profit.

**If the profit is near the max profit** for the IC then you will lock in max profit which will be your profit when the IC expires, even if the price trades out of the IC, plus any profit you made if the price reversed.

We do this conversion by taking the profitable IC and reversing the 2 verticals that make up the IC.

**IC Conversion:**

Take the verticals that make up the **profitable** IC per the example:

Profitable IC verticals - let's say this IC is up $450  
The current verticals are:  
SELL 5770 CALL  
BUY 5775 CALL

SELL 5695 PUT  
BUY 5675 PUT

and we reverse them by selling 2 new verticals per below:

Change the Sell to: BUY 5770 Change the Call to PUT  
Change the Buy to: SELL 5775 Change the Call to PUT

Change the Sell to: BUY 5695 Change the PUT to CALL  
Change the Buy to SELL 5675 change the PUT to CALL

So the 2 new verticals are:

BUY 5770 PUT  
SELL 5775 PUT

BUY 5695 CALL  
SELL 5675 CALL

We then sell these 2 verticals to open. Because you reversed them they will not close out your IC verticals. So this profitable IC will now have 4 verticals instead of the normal 2.

Once we sell and open these 2 new verticals, the 2 IC's you have will change into  
**image 2**, looking like a vertical going in the opposite direction.

The profit we locked in now reduces our max risk way down and also causes the non profitable IC to go from $400 profit to approx. $1,000 profit if the price reverses and trades into that IC.

You now start making profit if the price reverses.

**So with the conversion**

1. we locked in our profit
2. We used that profit to lower our risk and increase all of our profits if the price reverses
3. Now we make a profit if the price reverses and goes down.

**Risk Area**  
If the price trades into an IC, and then you do the conversion by selling 2 new verticals, and the price keeps going deeper into the IC, you end up locking in that loss. If the price does not come back then you are stuck with what ever your new max loss was.

**TIP**: This is a good time to take a profit and convert the IC.

**TIP**: This is a good time to let the IC expire.

My current platform is TradeStation. It's very powerful and flexible, but it's not perfect. I've been thinking about switching to Thinkorswim or IBKR. I'm curious if anyone here has experience with those platforms.



I'm also curious if anyone here uses a different platform that allows this kind of basket trading. I'm open to suggestions.



Thanks in advance!

### Answer:
What you want is called ""Multi-leg options trading""

Most platforms support it. 

You can also trade basket options. 

But the basket part of the basket option is not a basket, it's just a list of stocks. 

You can do multi-leg options in IBKR, but you need to do it in the charting window. You can't do it in the order entry window. 

The multi-leg order window is a little different than you're used to, and there are a few things to watch out for, but once you get it figured out, it's pretty easy.

[https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/learn/ibkrlimiteds](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/learn/ibkrlimiteds)

I've been using IBKR for a few years now and it's worked out really well for me.

If you're trading more than 100 trades per month, you'll also need to look at the platform's commission schedule. 

If you're not doing that many trades, it's probably not worth switching."
"How to deal with a sudden, but non emergency, expense?
I wanted to know what the boglehead way was to deal with a sudden unplanned but not emergency expense.

For context, I've been living in my current place for the last 4 years (in the US). Every year, the rent has increased by about $100 a month. I'm happy with the place, and the extra $100 wasn't a burden thankfully. This year, out of the blue, my rent renewal offer was a price that is $1000 above my current rent. I'm assuming they want to kick me out because the landlord probably found a buyer. Fair enough, good for them. But this means that I have to move in a couple of months time. 

Usually, this needs a bit of overhead with moving expenses, deposits and whatnot. What's the boglehead way to deal with this? I don't really want to touch my emergency fund as I don't think this is an emergency and I'd like to save it for an actual emergency (a layoff for example).

Paying for movers, etc) and then use my regular income for any extra expenses, then dip into emergency funds if needed.

Comment: What's the difference between an emergency fund and an unexpected expense fund?

Comment: @DheerajKumar - I'm not sure. In my mind, I'm assuming an emergency fund is something you have in case of a layoff, while unexpected expenses are a more general category of expenses that are not planned.

Comment: For me, an unexpected expense is something I didn't anticipate, but that I can handle without needing an emergency fund. For example, if I suddenly had to buy a new car because mine was stolen, that's an unexpected expense, but I wouldn't need to dip into my emergency fund to cover it.

Comment: @DheerajKumar - I think I get what you're saying. So I'll probably put any extra expenses into my emergency fund (security deposit, movers, etc) and then dip into it if needed.

Answer: In my opinion, this is one of the reasons why you need to have some sort of an emergency fund.  If you have an emergency fund, then you can deal with this sudden, unexpected expense with no worries.

I would recommend that you keep your investments going as normal.  However, you may want to consider parking the extra money that you would normally spend on your investments in a high interest savings account.  This would allow you to use it as an emergency fund, but still keep it in the market.

Comment: @user101010 Yes, this is a good approach.  If you want to keep the investments going, then the high interest savings account is a good idea.

Answer: The best way is to have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months worth of expenses) so that you don't have to touch your investments to pay for it.

Just to update everyone. I've decided to sell my old apartment and use the profit to pay for the new apartment. I'm selling it because I can't really afford the new apartment on my regular income. I'm hoping to get around $40k profit. I'm going to take $10k to pay for the new apartment deposit and pay for movers. I'm hoping to sell it quickly as it's a very desirable apartment.

I sold my old apartment for $430k. I'm now living in the new apartment. I've used $100k from the profit to pay for the new apartment deposit and movers. I've used the rest to buy a new car. I still have $150k in the emergency fund.

###Emergency fund vs general fund

I think it's important to distinguish between an emergency fund and a general fund that you can use for non-emergencies.

An emergency fund is for emergencies. Losing your job, medical emergencies, etc. You should have 3-6 months of expenses in it.

A general fund is for non-emergencies. Your new apartment rent, or paying for movers. You should have a general fund with your regular income. This fund should be relatively small and have low interest rates.

###Pause all investments

It's generally a good idea to pause your investments for a few months if you need to cover some expenses. This way, you don't lose money and you keep your returns compounding.

###Sell some of your stock

Selling stocks is generally a bad idea as you're going to incur capital gains tax. Also, you'll also have"
"Open interest
Is there a way of to obtain a summary of open interest at all the various price levels, across all expirations?","I'm not exactly sure what you mean by ""all the various price levels"" -- could that mean all strikes? But in any case, yes, there are summary OI and volume numbers by ticker and by market. The by ticker is the summed OI for all puts and calls, all strikes, all expirations, of a single ticker symbol.

For example, here are the tickers ranked from highest to lowest total OI:

You could use OptionFair's OI calculator, although it's not as simple as you might hope.
This is an OI calculator for the US markets. It is not intended for use with the UK or European markets, which are not as well documented as the US.
The calculator is fairly easy to use, but you will need to know the contract code and expiration date. You can get these from the contract specification page.
The US options market is also divided into a number of exchanges, which is why the contract code is required. The exchanges are as follows:
ISE (International Securities Exchange)
NYSE Arca Options (NYSE Arca)
CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange)
ISE (International Securities Exchange) - ISE is also known as ISE Gemini
NYSE Arca Options - NYSE Arca is also known as NYSE Arca Options
CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) - CBOE is also known as CBOE Options
You can find the contract code for an option by right-clicking on the option in the trading window and selecting ""Properties"". The contract code is in the ""Market"" column.
The expiration date is the date on which the option expires. This is displayed in the trading window.
Once you have the contract code and expiration date, enter them into the OI calculator. The calculator will then display the open interest for the contract code.
The open interest is the number of open positions for the contract code at the expiration date.

I'm looking for a tool that could help me see open interest at different price levels, across different contracts.

Does something like this exist?

###Edit:
I should have been clearer. I’m looking for a tool that would show open interest at different price levels, across different contracts, as well as the open interest itself.

###Edit2:
I have found a tool, it's called ICE, it's a paid tool but it's worth it."
"Any reason to not buy this World ETF? ISHARES vs AMUNDI

Answer: It depends on the broker, but usually, you don't pay a fee when you buy stocks, you pay it when you sell them.

For instance, my broker, Interactive Brokers, doesn't charge any fee for buying stocks, but they do charge a fee when you sell them.

Comment: Yes, I know, but in this case I have to buy and sell both. So if I buy 1000 shares of Amundi, I would pay 1,5 € in fees and if I buy 1000 shares of Ishares I would pay 0,00 €. So I think I would pay more if I buy Amundi.

Comment: @MihaiMuntean That's incorrect. When you buy stocks, you pay a commission, but when you sell them, you don't pay any commission. You pay the commission when you buy, not when you sell. That's why when you buy stocks, it's a good idea to buy 1000 shares at once.

Comment: @MihaiMuntean Yes, you pay a fee for buying. But you pay a fee for selling, too.","Any reason to not buy this World ETF? ISHARES vs AMUNDI
