        Citi says odds of recession in US close to 45%, largest effect of tariffs to happen in second half
[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citi-says-odds-recession-us-142247303.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citi-says-odds-recession-us-142247303.html)

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup's Chief Economist Nathan Sheets said on Tuesday the U.S. has a 40% to 45% chance of recession as the economy suffers the impact of tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump on China and other trading partners.

Sheets expects GDP to grow in the second quarter, pushed by consumers rushing to make purchases ahead of tariffs coming into effect. The largest impact on U.S. growth is expected during the second half of the year, Sheets told clients in a conference call.

        Widower finance advice after wife passed away and more then half income is gone.
Ok so I'm writing this on a whim to keep my brain busy for a moment. My wife passed away on sunday and she made about 60% of our income. My current main bills are more then i can afford without changing something. 
The main thing i need help deciding on is if I should refinance the house ASAP or wait for better rates.

Mortgage 3030 monthly
Principal is at about 435k at 7.3%.

I currently have 50k in a HYSA at 4% and we have a 275k life insurance policy that I'll get eventually. So I'm looking at it like if I get the money and have 300k in the HYSA I'll get 1k per month I can use towards Mortgage and  The rest will pay for funeral and pay off the truck we just bought and the camper. She also has a ROTH but im. Not sure exactly what's in that but it's around 20k. 

There's obviously a lot of variables im leaving out to simplify this but I'm hoping to have something kinda nudge me a way since my brain isn't exactly working 100% at the moment. 

Suppose I should show my income too...im currently able to work overtime and I'm getting 105 per diem daily but those are extras so its not guaranteed. Otherwise I made almost 80k last year with some overtime using 4 weeks of  PTO. Currently taking home 1850 weekly but a normal week, 40 hrs no overtime or per diem at 35.11 an hour take home in the 1100 range. 

I'm sure I'm forgetting something important but let's start with this.

        ",Sorry for your loss. Your mortgage is obviously your biggest liability. I’d consider selling the house and downsizing. There’s no practical way for you to replace 60% of your household income.  Trying to work more or selling off assets to offset the loss in revenue isn’t a viable long term solution.,"1.

Comment: @JoeTaxpayer - The question is specific to one person's situation. It's not like the site where they just give you a list of 1000 ways to invest your money and then you have to pick the best one.

        Advise on etf ..
Hello new to trading ..wanting to put $150,000 into a few etfs for 10 years with contributes everyweek about $200, what is you guys opinion of Fang to high risk? Any advise would be great ..

        ",For me  QGRO or GARP+ FNGS+ SPMO+AVUV( after we are in rate reduction period keeping low rates) + International but not VXUS more like picking eu latam China India etfs .,"1. I think that is a great plan, especially if you have a long-term goal. I don't know how you have $150k, but if you can put $200 a week in for 10 years you should be able to save $200k.
        2. I have never heard of that fund, but I do know that a lot of people have done very well with FANG.
        3. I think you should put your money in a low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500. That way, you will get a very nice return on your money and it will be a lot safer than a fund like FANG.
        4. I don't know that I would buy FANG. I would probably put my money in a low-cost index fund.

Comment: Please add more context.

Answer: There's a number of things to look at here.

The first thing to note is that the data is not formatted in the way you might expect. It's not in a CSV or text file. It's a TSV file, which means that each line is delimited by a tab character.

To parse this, you'll need to use a library that supports reading TSV files. For Python, I'd recommend using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which has a method [read_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) that can read a TSV file.

Once you've loaded the data, you'll want to take a look at it. You can do this by printing it out to the console, or by using a tool like [pandas' TableView](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/pandaspowerful.html#pandas.io.formats.text.TableView), which will allow you to view the data in a more readable","I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

"Here is a Reddit post:
        Are Target Date Funds the best choice for *tax advantaged accounts”?
Why are Target Date Funds (TDF) the best choice for most people \*in tax advantaged accounts\* who want to use a Boglehead strategy.   Once your choose your TDF fund that matches your investment strategy (that may or may not line up to the year listed.) The TDF takes the ""and chill"" to the next optimal level.

   

TDF do two things very efficiently and often at the same time.  

1.  Buy low / Sell high  



2.  Automatic rebalancing

 

 

For example, let’s consider a simplistic TDF composed of two sub-funds in the following percentages:

 

VT   60%

 

BND  40%

 

 

Note 1:  TDF funds keep money in cash for ease of transactions.   If person A buys $2,000 of the TDF and person B sells $1,000 of the TDF, all that will go in and out from the cash.   These examples ignore that or assume larger amounts. 

 

Note 2:  The targets in real life are not perfect percentages with absolutes.  I think I read that Vanguard allows up to 2% (200 basis points) variance for their TDFs.

 

Note 3:  What makes them great for tax advantaged accounts (like 401(k), IRA, Roth) makes them less efficient for taxable accounts. 

 

Examples below are simplified.

  

 

 

For new money coming in (buying), the TDF manager will buy in the sub-fund that is underrepresented, aka – buy the dip.

 

1)  If VT has risen to 63% of the total fund and BND is 37%, the fund manager will direct all new money to buy BND (the less expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40.

 

2)  If VT falls to 57% of the total fund and BND is 43%, the fund manager will direct all new money to buy VT (the less expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40.

 

 

 

For money going out (selling), the TDF manager will sell the sub-fund that is overrepresented aka – profit taking



3)  If VT has risen to 63% of the total fund and BND is 37%, the fund manager will sell VT (the more expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40.

 

4)  If VT falls to 57% of the total fund and BND is 43%, the fund manager will sell BND (the more expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40.

 

 

   

For larger swings, when the fund is out of target and buy/sell orders are not enough, funds will rebalance when the sub-funds hit a pre-defined out of range limit (for this example, 2% off target).  

 

5)  If VT has risen to 63% of the total fund and BND is 37%, the fund manager will sell VT (the more expensive option) to buy BND (the less expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40 .

 

6)  If VT falls to 57% of the total fund and BND is 43%, the fund manager will sell BND (the more expensive option) to buy VT (the less expensive option) until we again reach the 60/40.
